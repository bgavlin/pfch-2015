References to the Ranch Boys are found as early as 1930, though they may have been on earlier. They broadcast over KTM those first few years, nearly every day and at various times. Jack Ross, a versatile actor and producer apparently served as Pinto Pete, with Joe \"Curley\" Bradley and Ken \"Shorty\" Carson rounding out the trio. All three had acted as stuntmen. They also appeared in a few movies, including <i>It Happened One Night</i> and <i>In Old Monterey</i>. The first recorded notice of the <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Pinto_Pete_and_His_Ranch_Boys\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pinto Pete and His Ranch Boys</a> that researcher Ben Kibler was able to locate was a December 13, 1933 broadcast in Sandusky, Ohio. Mentions of the broadcast appeared through 1936. In 1935, they auditioned for the Tom Mix radio show in Chicago and Curley got the part of \"Pecos\", Ross got the lead of \"Tom Mix\", and Carson was to play bit parts. But Ross only got to play Mix once. While in Hollywood doing some movies in the summer of 1938, they rode their horses from Hollywood to Chicago in a publicity stunt that landed them on <i>National Barn Dance</i> for three months. Researcher Ryan Ellett perused the Los Angeles Times from 1930 to 1935 and turned up a few mentions that indicate the trio might have moved on to better pastures. Producer Grace Gibson introduced Australia to <i>Pinto Pete And The Ranch Boys</i> about 1934, according to researcher Ian Grieves, and the program was heard off and on through 1944. They were on the Blue Network in the U.S., according to a 1940 magazine ad, and on a Phoenix Arizona station in 1952. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">See also the OTRR Companion Release <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Pinto_Pete_and_His_Ranch_Boys\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pinto Pete and His Ranch Boys</a>.</font></b></i></p> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

The saga of fighting men who rode the rim of empire and the dramatic story of Lee Quince, Captain of Cavalry\". When Norman Macdonnell created <i>Fort Laramie</i> in late 1955, he made it clear to his writers that historical accuracy was essential to the integrity of the series. Correct geographic names, authentic Indian practices, military terminology, and utilizing actual names of the original buildings of the real fort, was insisted upon. So when the radio characters referred to the sutler's store (which is what the trading post was called prior to 1870), the surgeon's quarters, Old Bedlam (the officers' quarters) or the old bakery, they were naming actual structures in the original fort. While Macdonnell planned to use the same writers, soundmen, and supporting actors in <i>Fort Laramie</i> that he relied upon in <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Gunsmoke\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gunsmoke</a>, he naturally picked different leads. Heading up the cast was a 39 year old, Canadian-born actor with a long history in broadcasting and the movies, Raymond Burr. He had begun his career in 1939, alternating between the stage and radio. He turned to Hollywood, and from 1946 until he got the part of Captain Lee Quince in <i>Fort Laramie</i> in 1956, he had appeared in thirty-seven films. A few were excellent (<i>Rear Window</i>, <i>The Blue Gardenia</i>) some were average (<i>Walk a Crooked Mile</i>, <i>A Place in the Sun</i>) but many were plain awful (<i>Bride of Vengeance</i>, <i>Red Light</i>, and <i>Abandoned</i>). With Burr in the lead, Macdonnell selected two supporting players: Vic Perrin as \"Sgt. Goerss\" and Jack Moyles as \"Major Daggett\", the commanding officer of the post. (The original Fort Laramie usually had a Lieutenant Colonel as the C.O. but Macdonnell probably preferred a shorter military title.) Perrin, a 40 year old veteran radio actor had been in countless productions, but had achieved name recognition only on <i>The Zane Grey Show</i> where he played the lead, \"Tex Thorne.\" Jack Moyles was also a busy radio actor, having started in 1935 in <i>Hawthorne House</i>, with later major roles in <i>Romance</i>, <i>Twelve Players</i>, <i>Night Editor</i> as well as the lead in <i>A Man Called Jordan</i>. From 1947 to 1948 he was a regular in <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i>, which Norman Macdonnell directed, although this may not have been their first association. By the mid-1950s when <i>Fort Laramie</i> began, most of the actors on the west coast were doing some television and movie work so the program was rehearsed and taped for transcription during the evening. Once a week the cast and crew gathered at CBS Studio One in Hollywood to tape the show. In 1956 this was the last radio production studio in use in California. The series debuted on January 22, 1956 with an episode entitled \"Playing Indian.\" <i>Fort Laramie</i> aired forty one episodes from January 22, 1956 to October 28, 1956. An audition episode was recorded on July 25, 1955. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Fort Laramie <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>April 13, 2012 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 3 <b>Number of CDs: </b>2 <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

The show moved to Hollywood on May 25, 1936 with the production of <i>The Legionnaire and the Lady</i>, based on the film <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco_%28film%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morocco</a></i>, starring <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlene_Dietrich\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marlene Dietrich</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clark Gable</a>.

Indeed, production would halt if necessary on a film if performers were called to appear on Lux. When the actors were not available, others stepped in.

Ironically, the episode was titled \"Devil Stone\" and was the last dramatic radio play from a series that had its roots in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-time_radio\" rel=\"nofollow\">golden age of radio. </a>. What began as a \"new series frankly dedicated to your horrification and entertainment\" took on a life of its own mostly due to the talents of some outstanding producers and adaptations and original stories from the cream of mystery writers of the time. The golden age of radio was truly the golden age of <i>SUSPENSE</i> as show after show broadcast outstanding plays which were \"calculated to intrigue...stir [the] nerves.\" It was the series' first producer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Spier\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Spier</a>, who set the framework of rules that was to stay with the show for most of its run. Mr. Spier determined that the series should deal with life-and-death situations established near the beginning of each play and then through the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bernard_Herrmann</a>'s musical coloring and the writer's characterizations slowly tighten the knot of <i>SUSPENSE</i>. Many of the early stories were written by the mystery writer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dickson_Carr\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Dickson Carr</a>. Others were by such fine writers as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Fletcher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Fletcher</a>, whose <i>SUSPENSE</i> play, \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry,_Wrong_Number#Radio_play\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sorry, Wrong Number</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1943/Suspense_430525_043_Sorry_Wrong_Number_128-44_28100_29m17s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/download)</a> was turned into a major motion picture; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Arthur,_Jr.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Arthur</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Richards\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert L.

The series also drew from the mystery writers of the day as well as the horror writers of literature; writers such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edgar Allan Poe</a> , <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft\" rel=\"nofollow\">H.

Sayers</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells\" rel=\"nofollow\">H. G. Wells</a>. Many of the stories produced by Mr. Spier are now classics of the genre.

But what foreboding does the hitchhiker hold for the driver? Another rule William Spier established was to make the series a place to hear the talents of Hollywood's famous actors. There rarely was a famous actor who did not appear on the series at some time. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Stewart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jimmy_Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cary Grant</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Humphrey Bogart</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Ball</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olivia de Havilland</a> and many others all made at least one appearance. The series had a generous budget from its network, CBS. In 1948 the series had become popular enough that it was decided to broadcast for a complete hour, instead of the former thirty minutes. The actor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_%28actor%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Montgomery</a> was brought in to introduce the plays, replacing the \"Man in Black\" character and occasionally star in them. This format lasted only six months most probably due to the realization that the show worked best within a thirty minute framework. It was at this time that William Spier left and over the years others came to produce the shows, each setting his own unique mark. Anton M. Leader, who came from producing another horror radio program, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_at_Midnight_%28radio_series%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Murder_at_Midnight</a>, added some lighter <i>SUSPENSE</i> stories which focused more on the central characters. Jimmy Stewart appeared in an excellent story about a paralysed war veteran who thinks he has found the man who imprisoned and tortured him. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fibber McGee and Molly</a> appeared in a tale about a killer on the loose in \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1949/Suspense_490203_326_Backseat_Driver_128-44_28499_30m03s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backseat Driver</a>.\" Probably the biggest change in <i>SUSPENSE</i> came under the producing eye of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Lewis_%28radio%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elliott Lewis</a>. Lewis brought in comic actors to play serious roles. Actors such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Benny\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Benny</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Skelton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Skelton</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzie_Nelson\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ozzie Nelson</a>. He also was not afraid to experiment using the series slot for classic \"murder\" stories such as \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello\" rel=\"nofollow\">Othello</a>.\" The series continued to produce high-quality drama, though there were many repeats as well as borrowing of scripts from other radio shows. While a number of film actors continued to star occasionally, many of the stars were from radio and television since radio as a dramatic art form was beginning to lose its popularity and budgets were tightened. The show was on the air for a little over twenty years beginning in January, 1942 and was rarely pre-empted. There were 947 performances. Nearly all (approximately 895) are available to collectors. When <i>SUSPENSE</i> left the air, radio was never to see the likes of such a series again. Now the great medium of radio where imagination can run free has been reduced to the occasional brilliant drama airing sporadically in some corner of the world. <i>SUSPENSE</i> was a golden moment in a golden age. A moment when the thrill of the nightime led the listener along the path of intrigue, horror and dangerous adventure.

The name \"Black Museum\" was coined in 1877 by a reporter from \"The Observer\", a London newspaper, although the museum is still referred to as the Crime Museum. It is this museum that inspired <i>The Black Museum</i> radio series, produced in London by Harry Alan Towers. From Jay Hickerson's \"The Ultimate History of Network Radio Programming and Guide To All Circulating Shows\", the earliest US broadcast date was January 1, 1952. Thirty nine shows, from the full syndication of fifty two shows, aired over Mutual stations from January 1, 1952 through June 24, 1952 and September 30, 1952 through December 30, 1952. This may be the earliest broadcast of the series worldwide. It was later broadcast over Radio Luxembourg starting May 7, 1953. Radio Luxembourg broadcast sponsored programs at night to England (the BBC was state-owned and had no commercials). The shows were sponsored by Dreft and Mirro (cleaning products). The series continued to be offered in syndication and was heard on AFRTS broadcasts and in the US on NPR stations through the 1960's, 70's and 80's. Some shows were broadcast by the BBC in England in 1994. This murder mystery series was based on true life cases from Scotland Yard's files. Each episode was based on an item or items of evidence in the museum. Orsen Welles hosted and narrated the shows. Mr. Welles opened each show slightly differently but followed a standard format. For example, the show, \"The Bathtub\", open as follows: <blockquote>\"This is Orson Welles speaking from London.\" (Big Ben starts himing in the background). \"The Black Museum, repository of death... Here, in this grim stone structure on the Thames which houses Scotland Yard, is a warehouse of homocide, where everyday objects, a piece of wire, a chemist's flask, a silver shilling, all are touched by murder.\" (dramatic music)</blockquote> Following the opening, Mr. Welles would introduce the museum's item or items of evidence that was central to the case, leading into the dramatization. He also provided narration during the show and ended each show with his characteristic closing from the days of his <i>Mercury Theater of the Air</i>, remaining \"obediently yours\". Harry Alan Towers produced the series from scripts written by Ira Marion. Music was composed and conducted by Sidney Torch. The museum was not open to the general public. It's purpose was then, and still is, for police training, although it did receive a considerable number of famous people, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is currently used as a lecture theater for the police and like bodies in various subjects of Criminology. But, thanks to Mr. Towers and Mr. Welles, we can still get a glimpse of what secrets are housed in <i>The Black Museum</i>. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>The Black Museum <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>March 10, 2005 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 2 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

CBS decided to use New York City as the backdrop for this series and to focus on the happenings in an actual police precinct. The premise was to put the listener into the drama from the opening phone call until the final report was written. The 21st was described as <blockquote>\"just lines on a map of the city of New York. Most of the 173,000 people wedged into the nine-tenths of a square mile between Fifth Avenue and the East River wouldn't know if you asked them that they lived or worked in the 21st.\"</blockquote> The detail was made up of 160 patrolmen, eleven sergeants, and four lieutenants, under the command of one captain - Frank Kennelly. It was mentioned in each episode's closing that, \"<i>21st Precinct</i> is presented with the official cooperation of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association an organization of more than 20,000 members of the Police Department, City of New York.\" The Captain was the primary character and also acted as the narrator. Three actors played the Captain's role: Everett Sloane as Kennelly for the first 109 episodes and returned briefly in episode 135; James Gregory as Vincent Cronin for episode 109-144; and Les Damon as Thomas Keough starting in episode 145 through the remainder of the series. In supporting roles were Ken Lynch as Lt. Matt King and Harold Stone as Sgt. Waters. Santos Ortega appeared frequently as Lt. Patrick \"Red\" Gorman. Ninety-two episodes are in circulation for this series. It is generally believed that they were all recorded off the air by one collector as they were broadcast; however, many episodes appear to have been circulating independently of one another in the early 1970s. Several dealer catalogs from that period list them for sale, stating 'dubbed from the original transcription disks'. NOTE: Updated Release!

With its premiere on the nationwide NBC hookup in 1935, <i>Lights Out</i> was billed \"the ultimate in horror.\" Never had such sounds been heard on the air. Heads rolled, bones were crushed, people fell from great heights and splattered wetly on pavement. There were garrotings, choking, heads split by cleavers, and, to a critic at Radio Guide, \"the most monstrous of all sounds, human flesh being eaten.\" Few shows had ever combined the talents of actors and imaginative writers so well with the graphic art of the sound technician. Wyllis Cooper, who created, wrote, and produced it, was then a 36-year-old staffer in Chicago's NBC Studios. Cooper created his horror \"by raiding the larder.\" For the purposed of <i>Lights Out</i> sound effects, people were what they ate. The sound of a butcher knife rending a piece of uncooked pork was, when accompanied by shrieks and screams, the essence of murder to a listener alone at midnight. Real bones were broken - spareribs snapped with a pipe wrench. Bacon in a frypan gave a vivid impression of a body just electrocuted. And the cannibalism effect was actually a zealous actor. Gurgling and smacking his lips as he slurped up a bowl of spaghetti. Cabbages sounded like human heads when chopped open with a cleaver, and carrots had the pleasant resonance of fingers being lopped off. Arch Oboler's celebrated tale of a man turned inside-out by a demonic fog was accomplished by soaking a rubber glove in water and stripping it off at the microphone while a berry basket was curshed at the same instant. The listener saw none of this. The listener saw carnage and death. Cooper left the show in 1936 and Oboler was given the job. Oboler lost no time establishing himself as the new master of the macabre. Between May 1936 and July 1938, he wrote and directed more than 100 <i>Lights Out</i> plays. To follow Cooper was a challenge: he was \"the unsung pioneer of radio dramatic techniques,\" but Oboler had passed the test with his first play. His own name soon became synonymous with murder and gore, though horror as a genre had always left him cold. Oboler aspired to more serious writing. Oboler's shows are well represented -- this series of <i>Lights Out</i> was syndicated in <i>The Devil and Mr. O</i> offerings of 1970 - 73.

Initially written by Leonard Lewis Levinson, it was one of broadcast history's earliest spin-off programs. The series was built around the character Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve, a regular element of the radio situation comedy <i> Fibber McGee and Molly</i>. The character was introduced in the October 3, 1939 episode (number 216) of that series. <i> The Great Gildersleeve</i> enjoyed its greatest popularity in the 1940s. Actor Harold Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spinoff and later in four feature films released at the height of the show's popularity. In <i> Fibber McGee and Molly</i>, Peary's Gildersleeve had been a pompous windbag and nemesis of Fibber McGee. \"You're a haa-aa-aa-aard man, McGee!\" became a Gildersleeve catchphrase. The character went by several aliases on Fibber McGee and Molly; his middle name was revealed to be \"Philharmonic\" in \"Gildersleeve's Diary\" episode on October 22, 1940. \"Gildy\" grew so popular that Kraft Foods—promoting its Parkay margarine—sponsored a new series featuring Peary's somewhat mellowed and always befuddled Gildersleeve as the head of his own family. Premiere <i> The Great Gildersleeve</i> premiered on NBC on August 31, 1941. It moves the title character from the McGees' Wistful Vista to Summerfield, where Gildersleeve oversees his late brother-in-law's estate and rears his orphaned niece and nephew, Marjorie and Leroy Forrester. The household also includes a cook named Birdie. While Gildersleeve had occasionally mentioned his (unseen) wife in some Fibber episodes, in his own series he is a confirmed bachelor. At the outset of the series, Gildersleeve administers a girdle manufacturing company (\"If you want a better corset, of course, it's a Gildersleeve\"); later and during the remainder of the show he serves as Summerfield's water commissioner. Family A key figure in the Gildersleeve home was (black) cook and housekeeper Birdie Lee Coggins (Lillian Randolph). In the first season, under writer Levinson, Birdie was often portrayed as less than intelligent, but she slowly developed as the real brains and caretaker of the household under Whedon and other writers. Marjorie (originally played by Lurene Tuttle, later by Louise Erickson and Mary Lee Robb) matured to a young woman through the 1940s. During the ninth season (September 1949-June 1950) she met and married Walter \"Bronco\" Thompson (Richard Crenna), star football player at the local college. Look devoted five pages in its May 23, 1950, issue to the wedding. After living in the same household for a few years, the newlyweds moved next door. Leroy (Walter Tetley), who remained age 10–11 during most of the 1940s, began to grow up in the spring of 1949, establishing relationships with the girls in the Bullard home across the street. He developed interests in driving, playing the drums and dreaming of a musical career. Neighbors and friends Outside the home, Gildersleeve's closest association was with the executor of his brother-in-law's estate, Judge Horace Hooker (Earle Ross), with whom he had many battles during the first few broadcast seasons. After a change in scriptwriters in January 1943, the confrontations slowly subsided and the two men became friends. During the second season, pharmacist Richard Q. Peavey (Richard LeGrand) and barber Floyd Munson (Mel Blanc for the first year, Arthur Q. Bryan from December 1942 onward) joined Gildersleeve's circle of acquaintances. In the fourth season, these three friends, along with Police Chief Donald Gates (Ken Christy), formed the nucleus of the Jolly Boys Club, whose activities revolve around practicing barbershop quartet songs between sips of Coca-Cola. Several women passed through Gildersleeve's life during the series, including three he almost married before settling into a pattern of casual dating. Decline and fall In 1950, Harold Peary was convinced to move <i> The Great Gildersleeve</i> to CBS, but sponsor Kraft refused to sanction the move. Peary, now contracted to CBS, was legally unable to appear on NBC as a star performer, but <i> Gildersleeve</i> was still an NBC series. This prompted the hiring of Willard Waterman as Peary's replacement. Peary, meanwhile, began a new series on CBS which attempted to reproduce the Gildersleeve show with the names changed. The Harold Peary Show, lasting one season, included a fictitious radio show within the show. This was Honest Harold, hosted by Peary's new character. Starting in mid-1952, some of the program's long-time characters (Judge Hooker, Floyd Munson, Marjorie and her husband, Bronco) were missing for months at a time. In their place were a few new ones (Mr. Cooley the Egg Man, and Mrs. Potter the hypochondriac) who would last only a month or so. By 1953, Gildersleeve's love life took center stage over his family and friends. His many love interests were constantly shifting, and women came and went with great frequency. In 1954 the show's format changed drastically. After missing the fall schedule, it finally appeared in November as 15-minute episodes that aired five times a week. Only Gildersleeve, Leroy and Birdie remained on a continuing basis. All other characters were seldom heard, and gone were Marjorie and her family as well as the studio audience, live orchestra and original scripts The material for this series synopsis was originally published at www.wikipedia.com <font size=\"-2\"></font> <b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>The Great Gildersleeve <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>May 11, 2015 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of DVDs/CDs: </b>2/9 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

This OTRR Collection is a Non-Certified one, containing series in which currently only one or two episodes are known to exist -- hence the name: \"Singles and Doubles Collection\". Almost every type genre is included. Radio -- called by some <i>The Theater of the Mind</i> -- has been with us since 1920 when stations WWJ of Detroit and KDKA of Pittsburg made the first regular commercial broadcasts. The first program aimed at entertaining the unseen audience followed close behind. Over the years since then, literally thousands of series have been broadcast nationally and thousands more in regional or local markets. Some endured for a few years, others for 20 or 30, and some unfortunately only had one episode broadcast. Of those thousands, some series saw some of their episodes saved for the future, some saw nearly all and others only one or two episodes. While the goal of the Old Time Radio Researchers Group is to preserve radios past by collecting, and archiving as many different series as possible and making them available to the community, we do not want to let the series that only had a minimum number of episodes to survive go unpreserved for future generations. To that end we have put together this unique collection of series. Most of the programs you will find here will be totally unfamilar to you, but they are informative and entertaining none the less. This is the second version of this collection that we have released. Since the first collection new broadcasts have surfaced, and others will undoubtely be found in the future. When and if that occurs, we will release a version three. From comedy to drama to cooking shows to music, you'll hear it all here, and every episode will be unique and different. They run the gamut, from the middle 20s to the early 70s, all showing us a glimpse of the past, when things were slower and families gathered round the radio each evening. Times when each person was hearing the same thing, but created a different picture in their minds of what the characters looked like, the scenery, location, and most important the sounds. Sounds that each found a different meaning in, but one that entertained, educated, and made the world a smaller place, where you could hear those stories that in the past were told to just a few, gathered round the dinner table, at a campfire, or in small audiences, but now the whole world could hear and enjoy. Some of these episodes may be misnamed or misdated. If you find such, please let us know. Additionally there may be some dead air space at the beginning or ending of some episodes.

Its total run consisted of 130 episodes of crime and mystery that quickly birthed a loyal following of listeners and swiftly gained the respect and approval from the radio world at large. This show boasted the genius of Robert Arthur and David Kogan of <i>Mysterious Traveler</i> fame along with famous mystery writers like John Dickson Carr and Brett Halliday who hosted the program and also included many familiar names from the deep pool of New York acting talent like Lawson Zerbe, Ann Shepherd, Santos Ortega, Ralph Bell, and William Zuckert. The program featured stories by well known writers of the time and chosen by \"guest experts\" like Craig Rice, Bruno Fisher, Lawrence Blochman and other household detective fiction names. The host would begin by saying something like \"This weeks show has been chosen for your approval by one of the worlds leading detective writers\", would then name the story, its author and the name of the guest expert. When the play came to a close the narrator would return to the air saying \"and so the curtain falls on\" –gives the title of the play again and gives a preview of next weeks drama. This radio show was such an immediate favorite that it won the prestigious \"Edgar Award\" for the best radio drama in 1950 after being on the air for only six months. This was no surprise given the fact that the Arthur/Kogan Collaboration had already achieved much success with <i>The Mysterious Traveler</i> which had been previously nominated in 1949, losing against the great <i>Inner Sanctum</i>.<br /><br /><font size=\"-2\"></font><br /><br /><hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b><br /><br /><b>Series Name: </b>Murder By Experts<br /><b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate<br /><b>Certification Date: </b>March 4, 2013<br /><b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1<br /><b>Number of CDs: </b>1<br /><br /><br />From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.  See \"Note\" Section below for more information on the OTRR.<br /></blockquote>",

As many film actors were used to numerous takes and not live performance, they sometimes suffered acute stage fright before the show. However, since most received $5,000 for their performance – in addition to free publicity for upcoming pictures – actors appeared in their original screen roles if they were available. Indeed, production would halt if necessary on a film if performers were called to appear on Lux. When the actors were not available, others stepped in. The plays were assembled and rehearsed for a week, in sharp contrast to many other shows, which required a minimal of an actor’s time.

That series lasted 41 broadcasts. Near the end of the year, the network launched <i>Have Gun, Will Travel</i> on November 11, 1958, which continued for 106 programs. In between, a very short series was offered and discontinued after only 16 broadcasts, <i>Luke Slaughter Of Tombstone</i>. Sam Buffington starred as Luke Slaughter, a Civil War cavalryman who turned to cattle ranching in post war Arizona territory near Fort Huachuca. William N. Robson, known from his work with such series as <i>Escape</i>, <i>Suspense</i> and <i>The CBS Radio Workshop</i>, directed. Sam Buffington enacted the title role on <i>Luke Slaughter of Tombstone</i>, another of CBS's prestigious adult Westerns. The series was produced and directed by William N. Robson, one of radio's greatest dramatic directors and Robert Stanley producer was aired from February 23 through June 15, 1958. Buffington portrayed the hard-boiled cattleman with scripts overseen by <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Gunsmoke\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gunsmoke</a> sound effects artist (and sometimes scriptwriter) Tom Hanley. Each program had an authoritative opening statement: \"Slaughter's my name, Luke Slaughter. Cattle's my business. It's a tough business, it's a big business. I got a big stake in it. And there's no man west of the Rio Grande big enough to take it away from me.\" Junius Matthews was heard as Slaughter's sidekick, Wichita. In his first adventure, tough-as-nails westerner Luke Slaughter guarantees he will bring a cattle herd to Tombstone despite the threats of rustlers and a spy among the ranks of his cowboys. Like the other CBS radio westerns, <i>Have Gun, Will Travel</i> or <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Frontier_Gentleman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frontier Gentleman</a>, this one had plenty of action, the productions were well done and well acted. <i>Luke Slaugher</i> was cut short, like a lot of other radio shows, by the steady pressure from TV. This CBS western series was only a short 16 broadcasts before ending. From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group. See \"Note\" Section below for more information on the OTRR. </blockquote>",

This OTRR Collection is a Non-Certified one, containing series in which currently only one or two episodes are known to exist -- hence the name: \"Singles and Doubles Collection\". Almost every type genre is included. Radio -- called by some <i>The Theater of the Mind</i> -- has been with us since 1920 when stations WWJ of Detroit and KDKA of Pittsburg made the first regular commercial broadcasts. The first program aimed at entertaining the unseen audience followed close behind. Over the years since then, literally thousands of series have been broadcast nationally and thousands more in regional or local markets. Some endured for a few years, others for 20 or 30, and some unfortunately only had one episode broadcast. Of those thousands, some series saw some of their episodes saved for the future, some saw nearly all and others only one or two episodes. While the goal of the Old Time Radio Researchers Group is to preserve radios past by collecting, and archiving as many different series as possible and making them available to the community, we do not want to let the series that only had a minimum number of episodes to survive go unpreserved for future generations. To that end we have put together this unique collection of series. Most of the programs you will find here will be totally unfamilar to you, but they are informative and entertaining none the less. This is the second version of this collection that we have released. Since the first collection new broadcasts have surfaced, and others will undoubtely be found in the future.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">STAND BY FOR CRIME</font></b></u></i></p> This show, from the early 1950s, is a good example of the true story style of delivery made popular in radio's classic crime shows <i>Gangbusters</i> and <i>Mr. District Attorney</i>. Of course, the best and most popular of the true crime shows was <i>Dragnet</i> -- the monotone, \"just the facts\" style demanded by Jack Webb in the show made two points at once: first, that the show wasn't a typical melodramatic crime show, as had been on radio since \"the good old days\", and more importantly, that we were along for the ride on another day at the office -- in this case, a policeman's “day at the office\". Not a true crime show, as this is drama, but this show features Chuck Morgan, as played by Glen Langen, a very believable news anchor at KOP, a Los Angeles radio station. He is pals with Lieutenant Bill Miggs of the police force, who tips him off to hot crime news. Also in on the capers is Morgan's \"Gal Friday\", Carol Curtis, played by Adele Jurgens. The three meet all types -- mostly on the shady side of the street. In real life, Glen and Adele were husband and wife, the two marrying in 1949. They had met on the movie set of <i>The Treasure of Monte Cristo</i>. On the show, the repartee between the two is strictly old school and quite enjoyable. The dialogue is solid and makes the most of the plots.

Fritz Lang used an similar premise in his 1930s German movie with Peter Lorre playing <i>M</i>, a psychopathic murderer of children. But the American radio series was even creepier. The unseen Whistler didn't kill anyone (that we know of), but he certainly loved watching murders take place, narrating them for us, and chuckling at the suffering of others instead of doing anything to stop it. Unlike <i>M</i>, he was never caught. He kept walking the streets every week for thirteen long years, whistling his ominous thirteen notes and telling us another tale of bizarre fate. Perhaps Fate is who the Whistler really was? He never provided any sir name, and the killer was usually punished by some twist of fate that only The Whistler seemed to expect. It is very likely <i>The Whistler</i> was inspired by <i>The Shadow</i>, which began nearly a decade earlier. Like the Shadow, the Whistler seemed to enter and exit the criminal underworld without ever being seen. He would watch the evil doers carry out their schemes, yet they never saw him, even though he would tell us what they were thinking in their presence. His voice sounded equally sinister to The Shadow, too. It was was a slithering tenor, hissing the \"s's\" and often laughing \"heh-heh-heh-hehheh!\" at the foolishness of the guilty. Both series had similar opening lines: <i>The Shadow</i> \"knew what evil lurked in the hearts of men\", whereas <i>The Whistler</i> \"knows many strange tales hidden in the hearts of men and women who have stepped into the shadows.\" When Bill Forman served 1/2 year in the military, Marvin Miller substituted as <i>The Whistler</i>. Also like <i>The Shadow</i>, several different actors played the title role over the course of <i>The Whistler</i> series. Bill Forman played it the most, but his announcer (Marvin Miller) substituted for him during the six months of his army duty (Buxton, 256). Gale Gordon and Joseph Kearns voiced the Whistler in earlier days, while Everett Clarke played the character in 1947 and Bill Johnstone did in 1948 (Dunning, 719). The last similarity was the saddest one. Both series ended about the time frame (in the mid 1950s). Crime increased in the following decades, maybe because the guilty felt they were no longer being watched and could get away with murder. Or could it be that the Whistler is saving up some more great stories to tell us about in the future? <font size=\"-2\">This Article courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.radiohorrorhosts.com/whistler.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.radiohorrorhosts.com/whistler.html</a>.</font> </blockquote>",

Indeed, production would halt if necessary on a film if performers were called to appear on Lux. When the actors were not available, others stepped in. The plays were assembled and rehearsed for a week, in sharp contrast to many other shows, which required a minimal of an actorâs time.

To get ideas for his novels he placed an advertisement in a newspaper saying \"Adventure wanted, will go anywhere, do anything, Box 13.\" The ads always brought fun adventures of all kinds: from racketeer's victim to psychotic killer looking for fun. Most of the episodes were based on Dan Holiday replying to a letter he received at Box 13. He would generally solve a mystery in the process, and return to his office in time to enjoy a hearty laugh at the expense of Suzy, his amusingly stupid secretary. He would certainly not meet the strictest requirements for private eyes (not licensed, collected no fees from clients), but the definition should stretch to sneak him in under the rope. In total there were 52 episodes of this radio program created. It was heard over the Mutual Broadcasting System as well as being syndicated. The series was produced by Mayfair Productions. <i>Box 13</i>, starring Alan Ladd as Dan Holiday. Sylvia Picker played Suzy, Dan Holiday's secretary and Edmond MacDonald as Lt. Kling.

Herb Butterfield was the Commissioner, a taskmaster shrouded in secrecy who served up the situations that Mitchell seems never to refuse. The Commissioner's secretary is played by Betty Moran. She actually seems to care about the Steve's welfare.

Johnny was an accomplished 'padder' of his expense account. The name of the show derives from the fact that he closed each show by totaling his expense account, and signing it \"End of report... Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\". Terry Salomonson in his authoritative \"A Radio Broadcast Log of the Drama Program Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", notes that the original working title was \"Yours Truly, Lloyd London\". Salomonson writes \"Lloyd London was scratched out of the body of (the Dick Powell) audition script and Johnny Dollar was written in. Thus the show was re-titled on this script and the main character was renamed. Why this was done was unclear â possibly to prevent a legal run-in with Lloydâs of London Insurance Company.\" Although based in Hartford, Connecticut, the insurance capital of the world, freelancer Johnny Dollar managed to get around quite a bit â his adventures taking him all over the world. There were some unusual devices used in the show that help set it apart from other shows. There was no partner, assistant, or secretary for Johnny. The character closest to a continuing role was that of Pat McCracken of the Universal Adjustment Bureau, who assigned Johnny many of his cases. Another atypical aspect gave the show additional credibility â frequently, characters on the show would mention that they had heard about Johnnyâs cases on the radio. Johnny often used his time when filling out his expense accounts to give the audience background information or to express his thoughts about the current case. No fewer than eight actors played Johnny Dollar. Dick Powell, of <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Rogues_Gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogueâs Gallery</a> fame, cut the original audition tape, but chose to do <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Richard_Diamond_Private_Detective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Diamond, Private Detective</a> instead. Gerald Mohr, of <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i> fame, auditioned in 1955, prior to Bob Bailey getting the title role. Through the first three actors to play Johnny Dollar (Charles Russell, Edmond O'Brien, and John Lund), there was little to distinguish the series from many other radio detective series. Dollar was just another hard-boiled detective in a medium that was overloaded with the stereotype. Charles Russell, the first to play the role, would throw silver dollars to bellboys and waiters. Luckily, this trite gimmick did not survive long. On October 3, 1955, after a hiatus of over a year, the show came back with a vengeance. A new production team, including director/writer Jack Johnstone, a new star, Bob Bailey, from the radio series <i>Let George Do It</i>, and a new format would set the series apart from its competitors. Johnny's cases were now a continuing serial, five days a week, for fifteen minutes each evening. With 75 minutes of airtime, minus commercials and openings and closings, there was sufficient time to develop good storylines and interesting characters. During this time, <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> attracted some of the best writers in Hollywood, including Jack Johnstone, E. Jack Neuman (using the pen name John Dawson), Robert Ryf, and Les Crutchfield. Bob Bailey also wrote a script while he was playing Johnny Dollar. He used the pen name Robert Bainter (Bainter was his middle name) as the scriptwriter for \"The Carmen Kringle Matter\", which was aired on Saturday, December 21, 1957 on the West Coast, and on the following day for the rest of the country. Bob Bailey, generally thought of as the most popular of the Johnny Dollars, brought a new interpretation to the character â tough, but not hard-boiled; streetwise, but not overly cynical, Bailey's Dollar was smart and gritty when he had to be. But Bailey's Johnny Dollar was also human. His character would get emotionally involved in a number of his cases. He had a streak of impatience, and would occasionally not fully listen to a witness and rush off on a tangent before realizing his mistake. The weekday serialized episodes are generally acknowledged as some of the finest radio detective shows ever produced. There were fifty six multi-part shows in all: fifty four five-part shows, one six-part show, and one nine-part show. The serialized episodes continued until November 2, 1956 when the series again reverted to a once a week, thirty minute format. Bob Bailey continued in the lead, until \"The Empty Threat Matter\" of November 27, 1960, when the Hollywood run ended. The guest stars and supporting casts were always first rate, attracting the best radio actors in both Los Angeles and New York. Pat McCracken was played by several actors â most frequently, by Larry Dobkin. Particularly noteworthy was the work of Virginia Gregg, who played many roles, including Johnny's girlfriend Betty Lewis. Harry Bartell was also a frequent guest, who did many of the Spanish dialect roles when Johnny went to a Latin American country. Other frequent guest performers were Parley Baer, Tony Barrett, John Dehner, Don Diamond, Sam Edwards, Herb Ellis, Frank Gerstle, Stacy Harris, Jack Kruschen, Forrest Lewis, Howard McNear, Marvin Miller, Jeanette Nolan, Vic Perrin, Barney Phillips, Jean Tatum, Russell Thomson, Ben Wright, and Will Wright. Vincent Price co-starred as himself in \"The Price of Fame Matter\" and went to Europe with Johnny on the case. In December 1960, the show moved to New York. Robert Readick started the New York run as Dollar, but only lasted a short while. Jack Johnstone continued to write for the show and submitted scripts from California. Johnstone wrote about 350 Johnny Dollar scripts under his own name and his pen names Sam Dawson and Jonathan Bundy. Johnstone wrote the last episodes of both <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> and <i>Suspense</i>. He used the Bundy pen name when writing the last <i>Suspense</i> episode, \"Devilstone\". And so, an era passed. <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> was the last continuing detective series of the Golden Age of Radio. Mandel Kramer was the last Johnny Dollar, and a close second in popularity to Bailey, when the final episode, \"The Tip-Off Matter\", was aired on September 30, 1962. <font size=\"1\">Material for this description was prepared by Stewart Wright.</font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

As many film actors were used to numerous takes and not live performance, they sometimes suffered acute stage fright before the show. However, since most received $5,000 for their performance – in addition to free publicity for upcoming pictures – actors appeared in their original screen roles if they were available. Indeed, production would halt if necessary on a film if performers were called to appear on Lux. When the actors were not available, others stepped in. The plays were assembled and rehearsed for a week, in sharp contrast to many other shows, which required a minimal of an actor’s time.

The documentary series was produced by Norman Corwin who was the recipient of the first One World Award by the Wendell Willkie Memorial and the Common Council for American Unity. First prize was a round-the-world trip. According to Time Magazine article of Monday, 27 Jan 1947, Norman Corwin began his trip in Jun 1947. He took with him CBS Recorder Lee Bland and 225 pounds of magnetic wire-recording equipment. The trip lasted four months, covered 42,000 miles and they visited 16 countries which produced 100 hours of recorded interviews. He interviewed heads of state and common people, people of all types regardless status or walks of life. The transcript alone produced 3700 typed pages. Norman Corwin, four recording engineers and six typists took three months to develop this documentary series. Each program covered a portion of the trip and made an important contribution to the public perception of the rest of the world to help heal some of the wounds of World War II. <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"3\">Brief History of the One World Award</font></b></u></i></p> Wendell Willkie was lawyer by trade and a Democrat; however, in 1940 Wendell ran for President on the Republican ticket, but lost to President Roosevelt. In 1942, after the United States entered World War II (which was heavily debated in America), Roosevelt sent Wendell on 50 day trip around the world to reassure our Allies of our commitment to freedom and the defeat of fascism. When Wendell returned he wrote \"One World\", a travelogue of his journey and plea for international cooperation after the war. The book was published in 1943 and quickly become a best seller. Wendell Willkie passed away in 1944 from a heart attack and in 1945 the One World Award was established in his honor. The first winner was Norman Corwin in 1946. A few other notable winners of this award were Fiorello La Guardia (1947), Albert Einstein (1948), John Huston (1949), and Roger Nash Baldwin (1950). From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

The Lennen and Mitchell ad agency wanted to produce a comedy series for Old Gold cigarettes, a brand of the Lorillard Tobacco Company. The show was patterned after the successful format used by the <i>Lux Radio Theatre</i> and Cecil B. DeMille. Preston Sturges, an up and coming director, was originally tapped to host the show, but was already committed elsewhere, and so suggested Harold Lloyd, a silent film star, with whom he had worked in the past. As this was his first radio program, Lloyd worked for many months to get over his fear of the microphone. Critics believed he was improving as the season progressed, and would have eventually mastered the art had the series lasted more than one season. Though the adapted scripts and the actors were top-notch, the show eventually suffered from its 30 minute format, as too much had to be cut from the original movie scripts. Lennen and Mitchell pulled the plug on the show on May 28, 1945 when they announced <i>Meet Me at Parky's</i> would air in its place. Currently, there are 30 of the 32 episodes still in circulation -- 29 come from the estate of Harold Lloyd, in the original un-cut version, and one from the Armed Forces Radio Service. <font size=\"-2\"></font> <b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Old Gold Comedy Theater <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>February 22, 2012 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>2 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

Johnny was an accomplished 'padder' of his expense account. The name of the show derives from the fact that he closed each show by totaling his expense account, and signing it \"End of report... Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\". Terry Salomonson in his authoritative \"A Radio Broadcast Log of the Drama Program Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", notes that the original working title was \"Yours Truly, Lloyd London\". Salomonson writes \"Lloyd London was scratched out of the body of (the Dick Powell) audition script and Johnny Dollar was written in. Thus the show was re-titled on this script and the main character was renamed. Why this was done was unclear – possibly to prevent a legal run-in with Lloyd’s of London Insurance Company.\" Although based in Hartford, Connecticut, the insurance capital of the world, freelancer Johnny Dollar managed to get around quite a bit – his adventures taking him all over the world. There were some unusual devices used in the show that help set it apart from other shows. There was no partner, assistant, or secretary for Johnny. The character closest to a continuing role was that of Pat McCracken of the Universal Adjustment Bureau, who assigned Johnny many of his cases. Another atypical aspect gave the show additional credibility – frequently, characters on the show would mention that they had heard about Johnny’s cases on the radio. Johnny often used his time when filling out his expense accounts to give the audience background information or to express his thoughts about the current case. No fewer than eight actors played Johnny Dollar. Dick Powell, of <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Rogues_Gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogue’s Gallery</a> fame, cut the original audition tape, but chose to do <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Richard_Diamond_Private_Detective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Diamond, Private Detective</a> instead. Gerald Mohr, of <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i> fame, auditioned in 1955, prior to Bob Bailey getting the title role. Through the first three actors to play Johnny Dollar (Charles Russell, Edmond O'Brien, and John Lund), there was little to distinguish the series from many other radio detective series. Dollar was just another hard-boiled detective in a medium that was overloaded with the stereotype. Charles Russell, the first to play the role, would throw silver dollars to bellboys and waiters. Luckily, this trite gimmick did not survive long. On October 3, 1955, after a hiatus of over a year, the show came back with a vengeance. A new production team, including director/writer Jack Johnstone, a new star, Bob Bailey, from the radio series <i>Let George Do It</i>, and a new format would set the series apart from its competitors. Johnny's cases were now a continuing serial, five days a week, for fifteen minutes each evening. With 75 minutes of airtime, minus commercials and openings and closings, there was sufficient time to develop good storylines and interesting characters. During this time, <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> attracted some of the best writers in Hollywood, including Jack Johnstone, E. Jack Neuman (using the pen name John Dawson), Robert Ryf, and Les Crutchfield. Bob Bailey also wrote a script while he was playing Johnny Dollar. He used the pen name Robert Bainter (Bainter was his middle name) as the scriptwriter for \"The Carmen Kringle Matter\", which was aired on Saturday, December 21, 1957 on the West Coast, and on the following day for the rest of the country. Bob Bailey, generally thought of as the most popular of the Johnny Dollars, brought a new interpretation to the character – tough, but not hard-boiled; streetwise, but not overly cynical, Bailey's Dollar was smart and gritty when he had to be. But Bailey's Johnny Dollar was also human. His character would get emotionally involved in a number of his cases. He had a streak of impatience, and would occasionally not fully listen to a witness and rush off on a tangent before realizing his mistake. The weekday serialized episodes are generally acknowledged as some of the finest radio detective shows ever produced. There were fifty six multi-part shows in all: fifty four five-part shows, one six-part show, and one nine-part show. The serialized episodes continued until November 2, 1956 when the series again reverted to a once a week, thirty minute format. Bob Bailey continued in the lead, until \"The Empty Threat Matter\" of November 27, 1960, when the Hollywood run ended. The guest stars and supporting casts were always first rate, attracting the best radio actors in both Los Angeles and New York. Pat McCracken was played by several actors – most frequently, by Larry Dobkin. Particularly noteworthy was the work of Virginia Gregg, who played many roles, including Johnny's girlfriend Betty Lewis. Harry Bartell was also a frequent guest, who did many of the Spanish dialect roles when Johnny went to a Latin American country. Other frequent guest performers were Parley Baer, Tony Barrett, John Dehner, Don Diamond, Sam Edwards, Herb Ellis, Frank Gerstle, Stacy Harris, Jack Kruschen, Forrest Lewis, Howard McNear, Marvin Miller, Jeanette Nolan, Vic Perrin, Barney Phillips, Jean Tatum, Russell Thomson, Ben Wright, and Will Wright. Vincent Price co-starred as himself in \"The Price of Fame Matter\" and went to Europe with Johnny on the case. In December 1960, the show moved to New York. Robert Readick started the New York run as Dollar, but only lasted a short while. Jack Johnstone continued to write for the show and submitted scripts from California. Johnstone wrote about 350 Johnny Dollar scripts under his own name and his pen names Sam Dawson and Jonathan Bundy. Johnstone wrote the last episodes of both <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> and <i>Suspense</i>. He used the Bundy pen name when writing the last <i>Suspense</i> episode, \"Devilstone\". And so, an era passed. <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> was the last continuing detective series of the Golden Age of Radio. Mandel Kramer was the last Johnny Dollar, and a close second in popularity to Bailey, when the final episode, \"The Tip-Off Matter\", was aired on September 30, 1962. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">ADVENTURE AHEAD!</font></b></u></i></p> <i>Adventure Ahead!</i> was a brilliant Summer feature for 1944. Comprised of fourteen stirring adventure novels and stories from among America's greatest fiction writers, its somewhat more masculine orientation may have kept some of the young females of the era listening to Frank Sinatra that summer instead of <i>Adventure Ahead!</i>. But it was indeed billed as 'famous stories for young people', not 'famous stories for young men'. And yet, how any rational programmer at NBC-Red could have construed the slant of this project to young people is anyone's guess. There's no discernible love interest, there are female protagonists, nor any female authorities or mentors for that matter. Of course this was the 1940s after all, still in the throes of the fight for equality on many fronts. It's just quite obvious that NBC-Red programmers were simply completely out of touch with their era. That having been said, each of these literary choices did have a uniting theme--defending Freedom, domestically and abroad. To be fair to NBC's programmers, there were several jingoistic, over the top, almost fascist 'public service programs' geared toward every facet of domestic population at one time or another during the World War II years and the Cold War Years that followed. So overlooking the slant for the time being, let's focus in on the selected stories and their themes. Virtually all of these stories were male-oriented, 'coming of age' tales of one type or another. Dana's <i>Two Years Before the Mast</i> was one of the books virtually any father would expect his son to have read by the time he was eleven. A stirring tale of independent thinking, the courage to act on it, and the satisfaction of correctly asserting one's convictions is always a satisfying read for boy and man alike. For young ladies, even during the 1940s, not so much. All it would have conjured up was more of the status quo the Rosie the Riveters and their daughters across America were fighting against, sweating to defeat, and earning the right to overturn. Sadly this same theme can be set forth in the other twelve selections as well. Suspending belief a bit further, <i>The Arrival of The Lily Bean</i>, ostensibly the one female oriented theme in the entire run, stems from Walter Dumaux Edmond's compilation of short stories that appeared over several installments in <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> and <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> entitled simply, <i>Young Ames</i>. The fact that this is one of the two exemplars of the series not in circulation doesn't help. But from what I can recall from the Saturday Evening Post installment of the same name, <i>The Arrival of the Lily Bean</i> was yet another male coming of age story as well--but in the romantic arena. T.B. Aldrich's <i>The Story of A Bad Boy</i>--as adapted--was a greatly abridged version of the original novel, which basically traced the entire life of the author at various critical 'coming of age' junctures throughout his life. What survives in the <i>Adventure Ahead!</i> installment is a series of vignettes of the 'bad behaviour' of the protagonist. The 'bad behaviours' are a series inspired pranks which, in the final analysis were instigated with the best of intentions. It's just that most of them backfired in one way or the other. <i>Inside The FBI</i> is a stirring tale of the inner workings of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Clearly fascinating fodder for the imagination of any young male. Reportedly blessed by J.Edgar Hoover himself, it doesn't take much thought to imagine how the piece is slanted. With most of the emphasis on FBI scientific procedure and analysis, there's plenty here to fire the imagination of any young man. <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is a classic of American literature. Even abridged, it's easy to understand how naturally this selection sprang to mind when developing the project. Daniel Defoe's classic exists here in skeleton form only, but it's a good listen to this day. And if it prompts you to reach for your own copy from the library shelf, so much the better. It's an amazing read--and re-read. <i>A Tooth for Paul Revere</i> is one of Stephen Vincent Benét's most enduring short stories. It's been adapted and readapted in hundreds of productions over Radio, Animation, Television, and Film. If you've never read it yourself, then don't miss the opportunity to listen to the <i>Adventure Ahead!</i> rendition. It captures all of the key elements of Benét's original story. <i>Toby Tyler</i> . . . is pure young male adventure fantasy, both delightfully spun and poignantly punctuated. One of the more realistically and sensitively portrayed productions, we found it one of the more enjoyable of the existing eleven exemplars. Waldo Fleming's <i>Talking Drums</i> is pure male juvenile escapism very much in the Jungle Jim or Tarzan mold, but with a bit more cerebral moral dilemmas interwoven into the script. One of the better recorded examples from this run, the foley work is wonderfully evocative and contributes to the many turns in the script. <i>The Biscuit Eater</i> by James Street is a wonderfully charming story of a boy and his dog, a useless 'biscuit eater' of a pup, saved from the drowning well by the boy who fell in love with the pup at first sight. It's one of the more enjoyable and inspirational programs of the thirteen. A wonderful little morality play, the touching interaction between a boy, his faith in his dog, and his love for his own father resolves itself in a wonderfully satisfying manner. Mabel Leigh Hunt's <i>Have You Seen Tom Thumb</i> is one of the two missing episodes from this production. It's still very easy to see why it was included in this anthology. The original story the fictionalized account of the famous dwarf, Charles Sherwood Stratton, who, as General Tom Thumb became a living legend in the Circus world, and eventually made a wonderful life for himself and his family in the process. From performing for the crowned heads of Europe saving P.T. Barnum from bankruptcy to meeting President Abraham Lincoln himself, Tom Thumb's life story is both a fascinating adventure and a tale of great inspiration to any young person with a physical limitation of any kind. Hubert Skidmore's <i>Hill Lawyer</i> is a wonderful adventure in small town human relations and interaction. Both inspirational and well-grounded in basic American decency, there's no question that this program left an impression on its young listeners--and perhaps a few of it's older listeners as well. G.A Henty's <i>One of the 28th</i> and <i>Greenmantle</i>, the wonderful espionage story by John Buchan round out the last two installments of this adventure series. Very similar in their militaristic slant, they're both wonderful period adventures in their own right. The former, a rousing vignette of the Battle of Waterloo, is perhaps the one exemplar in circulation that provides a heroine as a protagonist. <i>Greenmantle</i>, by contrast, is a riveting tale of spycraft and espionage at the turn of the century. Espionage adventures almost always build far more anxiety and anticipation in the course of the script and this one is no exception. The series closed prematurely with Alexander Dumas' stirring <i>The Three Musketeers</i>, the classic adventure story of four loyalist Musketeers, D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis who take a mission to England to retrieve a wooden box full of diamonds and eventually take down Cardinal Richelieu. Their motto, \"one for all, all for one\" becomes a popular rallying cry of enduring friendship and loyality for millions of youngsters throughout the world for two centuries. The series was overtaken by events with the NBC-Red-wide broadcast of the Sixth War Loan Drive on November 11, 1944, effectively ending the series. The better encodes of this remarkable Summer series are wonderful reminders of the type of inspirational fare of the 1940s during a world at War. Not preachy, not particularly jingoistic, but clearly selected and adapted to act as both a comfort and inspiration to the thousands of young people anxiously awaiting resolution of the War and the return of their brothers, fathers and uncles. In this respect alone, this gem of a short series is a definite keeper from The Golden Age of Radio. <font size=\"-2\">Information from <a href=\"http://www.digitaldeliftp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Digital Deli Online</a>.</font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Adventure Ahead <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>December 10, 2012 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

A total of 431 episodes were broadcast. <i>Casey, Crime Photographer</i> had more history than substance.

Originally appearing in the pages of <i>Black Mask</i>, under the watchful eyes of then-editor Joseph Shaw, Flashgun Casey was the originally fast-talking crime photographer, a big, hot-tempered Boston Mick with a gift for gab and a nose for trouble. No \"artiste\", Casey kept a bottle of hooch and a .38 in his desk drawer, and boasted of being able to put a \"slug where he aimed\" and having \"two big fists he knew how to use\". He appeared in several short stories in the pulps and several novels. Casey, whose first name was never revealed, was the major crime photographer at the fictional Morning Express newspaper. With the help of reporter Ann Williams, he tracked down criminals and solved numerous crimes on this popular mystery-adventure series. Often a picture snapped at a crime scene led Casey to play detective. Casey and Ann often enlisted the aid their police cheif friend, Captain Logan during each week's half-hour episode. In between assighments, crime investigators Casey and Ann went to their favorite tavern, 'The Blue Note', and discussed their adventures with their bartender friend Ethelbert. There the crowd was friendly and the music was more than a backdrop. The jazz piano belonged to Herman Chittison, Matt Crowley and Staats Cotsworth played Casey, with the latter playing the role longer: Alice Reinheart, Betty Furness, Jone Allison, Lesley Woods, and Jan Miner (best remembered in the role) played Ann at different times.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">THE HILLBILLY BOYS</font></b></u></i></p> W. Lee O'Daniel's musical career began in January 1931, when a West Texas fiddler named James Robert (Bob) Wills entered his Fort Worth office at Burrus Mill and Elevator Company. As general manager of the firm, O'Daniel had just canceled a radio program on which Wills and his fiddle band had been advertising Burrus Mill's Light Crust Flour. O'Daniel canceled it, as he said, \"because I didn't like their hillbilly music.\" So many cards and letters came into station KFJZ that O'Daniel had to put the show back on the air, and the band became known as the Light Crust Doughboys. When O'Daniel realized how much flour the show was selling, he became the announcer for the show and manager of the band. According to Wills, O'Daniel was an asset to the show. He had a flair for dramatization and publicity; he wrote poems and read them on the air and often had the band work out music for them. Though his songs never became national hits, they became known throughout Texas and the Southwest. He wrote \"Beautiful Texas,\" \"Put Me in Your Pocket,\" and a song for Franklin D. Roosevelt's war on the Great Depression, \"On to Victory Mr. Roosevelt\" (all in 1933). The Doughboy broadcast became one of the most popular and longlived shows in the history of the Southwest. The original Light Crust Doughboy show consisted of O'Daniel as announcer, Bob Wills on fiddle, Herman Arnspiger on guitar, and Milton Brown as vocalist. By the mid-1930s all had left the Doughboys, and each eventually had an important place in Texas music. In 1935 Burrus Mill fired O'Daniel, and he organized his own band, <i>The Hillbilly Boys</i>, and his own flour company, W. Lee O'Daniel Flour Company, manufacturers of Hillbilly Flour. Between September 1935 and December 1938 O'Daniel and the Hillbilly Boys did six recording sessions for Vocalion (later part of Columbia Records). Some of their recordings were far from hillbilly music; in general, they represent some of the best western swing that any band in the Fort Worth-Dallas area ever recorded. As a vocalist, Leon Huff was at his best on these recordings, consistently better than when he later recorded for Bob and Johnnie Lee Wills. Kitty Williamson, whom O'Daniel called Texas Rose, vocalized on several recordings. She was probably the first female singer in western swing; her recording of \"Baby Won't You Please Come Home\" was in the Bessie Smith tradition and was vocalized western swing at its best. Although some of his recordings were hillbilly, it was on his radio shows that O'Daniel promoted a hillbilly façade. His famous \"Pass the Biscuits Pappy\" smacked of the hillbilly and made the show, Hillbilly Flour, and O'Daniel popular. He read poems and gave brief lectures on morality, most of which he never practiced, according to his musicians. O'Daniel had bigger and more important things in mind than his hillbilly music, however. In 1938 he became a candidate for governor of Texas. He was probably the first candidate anywhere in the nation to use a fiddle band (or perhaps any kind of a band) as a principal part of a political campaign. He toured the state with his Hillbilly Boys, who began his rallies by playing \"Beautiful Texas\" (which O'Daniel strategically recorded the year before). After the band drew the crowd, O'Daniel gave a campaign speech. Then he sent members of his family and the band into the audience with miniature flour barrels to accept campaign contributions. The method was successful, though no one will ever know how much so, since the donations were all in cash. When he was elected governor, O'Daniel took his Hillbilly Boys with him to Austin and got all of them jobs with the state. For example, Kermit Whalin, a barber, became a state barber inspector. The musicians broadcast a show from the Governor's Mansionqv on Sundays, and so continued to build the image of Governor O'Daniel and keep his name before the people. Most of the musicians never saw the inside of the mansion; they played the show on the front porch and were never invited inside. When O'Daniel's daughter, Molly, married, he sent band member Jim Boyd and his wife an engraved invitation, but Boyd said, \"They stopped us at the church door and wouldn't let us in.\" When O'Daniel became a United States senator, he insisted that the band go with him to Washington but refused to tell them what salary they would receive. If they refused to go, they lost their state jobs immediately, and Jim Boyd was even evicted from his state-owned home. Practically every musician who played for O'Daniel believed he was selfish, unfair, and extremely ruthless. Aside from his politics and his personal qualities, O'Daniel was important in the music of Texas when it was in its formative years. Without his remarkable ability to promote and publicize, the innovative music of the Light Crust Doughboys might never have gained such vast popularity, and men like Bob Wills might have been known only in North and Central Texas. As governor, O'Daniel made the world aware that there was a distinctive Texas sound and that music was important enough to help a flour salesman attain the highest office in the state.

Goodman organization to radio stations across America. That initial syndication caught both the attention and entrepreneurial interest of Sampson R. Diamond, who sought to put a physical image and visual personality to the delightful 3-inch tall Elf. He contracted with the Hickox' syndicator, Harry S. Goodman to contract out the Hickox's for a 25-episode children's adventure anchored around the Christmas Holiday season. Thus was born the first image of Jump Jump and a fully fleshed out package of Jump Jump characters, dolls, merchandise displays and marketing materials to promote the new 25-episode serial as a Christmas adventure. This is similar to the highly successful <i>Cinnamon Bear</i> and <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Jonathan_Thomas_And_His_Christmas_On_The_Moon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jonathan Thomas and His Christmas On The Moon</a> adventure serials distributed almost ten years earlier.

For its last season, (1954-1955), the show moved to Tuesday nights at 9 on NBC.<br /><br /><i>Lux Radio Theatre</i> was always broadcast live, with a studio audience and a full orchestra accompanying the performance and providing musical transitions between scenes. As many film actors were used to numerous takes and not live performance, they sometimes suffered acute stage fright before the show. However, since most received $5,000 for their performance â in addition to free publicity for upcoming pictures â actors appeared in their original screen roles if they were available. Indeed, production would halt if necessary on a film if performers were called to appear on Lux. When the actors were not available, others stepped in. The plays were assembled and rehearsed for a week, in sharp contrast to many other shows, which required a minimal of an actorâs time. Regular players for the series included Jim and Marian Jordan, otherwise known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fibber McGee and Molly</a>. Hosts included <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cecil B.

Stewart was never better on the air than in this drama of Britt Ponset, frontier drifter created by Frank Burt. The epigraph set it up nicely: \"The man in the saddle is angular and long-legged: his skin is sun dyed brown. The gun in his holster is gray steel and rainbow mother-of-pearl. People call them both The Six Shooter.\" Ponset was a wanderer, an easy-going gentleman and -- when he had to be -- a gunfighter. Stewart was right in character as the slow-talking maverick who usually blundered into other people's troubles and sometimes shot his way out. His experiences were broad, but <i>The Six Shooter</i> leaned more to comedy than other shows of its kind. Ponset took time out to play <i>Hamlet</i> with a crude road company. He ran for mayor and sheriff of the same town at the same time. He became involved in a delighful Western version of <i>Cinderella</i>, complete with grouchy stepmother, ugly sisters, and a shoe that didn't fit. And at Christmas he told a young runaway the story of <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, Substituting the original Dickens characters with Western heavies. Britt even had time to fall in love, but it was the age-old story of people from different worlds, and the romance was foredoomed despite their valiant efforts to save it. So we got a cowboy-into-the-sunset ending for this series, truly one of the bright spots of radio. Unfortunately, it came too late, and lasted only one season. It was a transcribed show, sustained by NBC and directed by Jack Johnstone. Basil Adlam provided the music and Frank Burt wrote the scripts.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">INNER SANCTUM MYSTERIES</font></b></u></i></p> The anthology series featured stories of mystery, terror and suspense, and its tongue-in-cheek introductions were in sharp contrast to shows like <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Suspense\" rel=\"nofollow\">Suspense</a> and <i>The Whistler</i>. The early 1940s programs opened with Raymond Edward Johnson introducing himself as, \"Your host, Raymond,\" in a mocking sardonic voice. A spooky melodramatic organ score (played by Lew White) punctuated Raymond's many morbid jokes and playful puns. Raymond's closing was an elongated \"Pleasant dreeeeaams, hmmmmm?\" His tongue-in-cheek style and ghoulish relish of his own tales became the standard for many such horror narrators to follow, from fellow radio hosts like Ernest Chappell (on Wyllis Cooper's later series, <i>Quiet, Please</i>) and Maurice Tarplin (on <i>The Mysterious Traveler</i>). When Johnson left the series in May 1945 to serve in the Army, he was replaced by Paul McGrath, who did not keep the \"Raymond\" name and was known only as \"Your Host\" or \"Mr. Host\" (Berry Kroeger had substituted earlier for a total of four episodes). McGrath was a Broadway actor who turned to radio for a regular income. Beginning in 1945, Lipton Tea sponsored the series, pairing first Raymond and then McGrath with cheery commercial spokeswoman Mary Bennett (aka the \"Tea Lady\"), whose blithesome pitches for Lipton Tea contrasted sharply with the macabre themes of the stories. She primly chided the host for his trademark dark humor and creepy manner. The Creaking Door: The program's familiar and famed audio trademark was the eerie creaking door which opened and closed the broadcasts. Himan Brown got the idea from a door in the basement that \"squeaked like Hell.\" The door sound was actually made by a rusty desk chair. The program did originally intend to use a door, but on its first use, the door did not creak. Undaunted, Brown grabbed a nearby chair, sat in it and turned, causing a hair-raising squeak. The chair was used from then on as the sound prop. On at least one memorable occasion, a staffer innocently repaired and oiled the chair, thus forcing the sound man to mimic the squeak orally. Guest Stars: Its campy comedy notwithstanding, the stories were usually effective little chillers, mixing horror and humor in equal doses. Memorable episodes included \"Terror by Night\" (September 18, 1945) and an adaptation of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" (August 3, 1941). The latter starred Boris Karloff, who was heard regularly in the first season, starring in more than 15 episodes and returning sporadically thereafter. Other established stars in the early years included Mary Astor, Helen Hayes, Peter Lorre, Paul Lukas, Claude Rains, Frank Sinatra, and Orson Welles. Most of the lead and supporting players were stalwarts of New York radio. These included Santos Ortega, Mercedes McCambridge, Berry Kroeger, Lawson Zerbe, Arnold Moss, Leon Janney, and Mason Adams. Players like Richard Widmark, Everett Sloane, Burgess Meredith, Agnes Moorehead, Ken Lynch, and Anne Seymour, also found fame via the <i>Inner Sanctum Mysteries</i>. Out of more than 500 programs broadcast, only about 200 remain in circulation, sometimes minus dates or titles. <font size=\"-2\">Information taken from www.wikipedia.org</font> From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

Ironically, the episode was titled \"Devil Stone\" and was the last dramatic radio play from a series that had its roots in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-time_radio\" rel=\"nofollow\">golden age of radio. </a>. What began as a \"new series frankly dedicated to your horrification and entertainment\" took on a life of its own mostly due to the talents of some outstanding producers and adaptations and original stories from the cream of mystery writers of the time. The golden age of radio was truly the golden age of <i>SUSPENSE</i> as show after show broadcast outstanding plays which were \"calculated to intrigue...stir [the] nerves.\" It was the series' first producer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Spier\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Spier</a>, who set the framework of rules that was to stay with the show for most of its run. Mr. Spier determined that the series should deal with life-and-death situations established near the beginning of each play and then through the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bernard_Herrmann</a>'s musical coloring and the writer's characterizations slowly tighten the knot of <i>SUSPENSE</i>. Many of the early stories were written by the mystery writer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dickson_Carr\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Dickson Carr</a>. Others were by such fine writers as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Fletcher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Fletcher</a>, whose <i>SUSPENSE</i> play, \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry,_Wrong_Number#Radio_play\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sorry, Wrong Number</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1943/Suspense_430525_043_Sorry_Wrong_Number_128-44_28100_29m17s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/download)</a> was turned into a major motion picture; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Arthur,_Jr.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Arthur</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Richards\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert L. Richards</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton_Fine\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morton Fine</a> and David Friedkin. The series also drew from the mystery writers of the day as well as the horror writers of literature; writers such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edgar Allan Poe</a> , <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft\" rel=\"nofollow\">H. P. Lovecraft</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Woolrich\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cornell Woolrich</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_L._Sayers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dorothy L. Sayers</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells\" rel=\"nofollow\">H. G. Wells</a>. Many of the stories produced by Mr. Spier are now classics of the genre. Listen to the likes of \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_in_Cypress_Canyon\" rel=\"nofollow\">The House in Cypress Canyon</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1946/Suspense_461205_222_The_House_in_Cypress_Canyon_128-44_28764_30m20s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/downoad)</a> as a young couple encounters something in the closet of their new home, something horrible and dangerous; or \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitch-Hiker_%28radio_play%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">The_Hitch-Hiker</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1942/Suspense_420902_011_The_Hitch-Hiker_128-44_29227_30m50s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/download)</a> in which a man driving cross-country seems to be haunted by an ominous figure, who keeps reappearing trying to get a ride. But what foreboding does the hitchhiker hold for the driver? Another rule William Spier established was to make the series a place to hear the talents of Hollywood's famous actors. There rarely was a famous actor who did not appear on the series at some time. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Stewart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jimmy_Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cary Grant</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Humphrey Bogart</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Ball</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olivia de Havilland</a> and many others all made at least one appearance. The series had a generous budget from its network, CBS. In 1948 the series had become popular enough that it was decided to broadcast for a complete hour, instead of the former thirty minutes. The actor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_%28actor%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Montgomery</a> was brought in to introduce the plays, replacing the \"Man in Black\" character and occasionally star in them. This format lasted only six months most probably due to the realization that the show worked best within a thirty minute framework. It was at this time that William Spier left and over the years others came to produce the shows, each setting his own unique mark. Anton M. Leader, who came from producing another horror radio program, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_at_Midnight_%28radio_series%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Murder_at_Midnight</a>, added some lighter <i>SUSPENSE</i> stories which focused more on the central characters. Jimmy Stewart appeared in an excellent story about a paralysed war veteran who thinks he has found the man who imprisoned and tortured him. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fibber McGee and Molly</a> appeared in a tale about a killer on the loose in \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1949/Suspense_490203_326_Backseat_Driver_128-44_28499_30m03s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backseat Driver</a>.\" Probably the biggest change in <i>SUSPENSE</i> came under the producing eye of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Lewis_%28radio%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elliott Lewis</a>. Lewis brought in comic actors to play serious roles. Actors such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Benny\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Benny</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Skelton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Skelton</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzie_Nelson\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ozzie Nelson</a>. He also was not afraid to experiment using the series slot for classic \"murder\" stories such as \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello\" rel=\"nofollow\">Othello</a>.\" The series continued to produce high-quality drama, though there were many repeats as well as borrowing of scripts from other radio shows. While a number of film actors continued to star occasionally, many of the stars were from radio and television since radio as a dramatic art form was beginning to lose its popularity and budgets were tightened. The show was on the air for a little over twenty years beginning in January, 1942 and was rarely pre-empted. There were 947 performances. Nearly all (approximately 895) are available to collectors. When <i>SUSPENSE</i> left the air, radio was never to see the likes of such a series again. Now the great medium of radio where imagination can run free has been reduced to the occasional brilliant drama airing sporadically in some corner of the world. <i>SUSPENSE</i> was a golden moment in a golden age. A moment when the thrill of the nightime led the listener along the path of intrigue, horror and dangerous adventure.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">THEATRE ROYAL</font></b></u></i></p> This fine British anthology series, features plays based on the best of literature, films and English theater. Produced in two series, Sir Lawrence Olivier and Sir Ralph Richardson serve as hosts, narrators and many times portray the leading roles. The program apparently was developed as a vehicle to capitalize on Olivier’s name and talent. His career spanned over 50 years and continues into the 21st century, as in 2004, 15 years after his death, he was starring as Dr. Totenkopf in a Hollywood fantasy film titled, <i>Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow</i>. This was accomplished by the producers who selected footage of Lord Olivier from various films and used to create a villainous leader of killer robots in the film. Jude Law, who stars in the film, said film-makers used Olivier because few other actors possessed his authority. Sir Ralph Richardson from 1954 – 1955 played the character of Dr. John Watson in another Harry Alan Towers radio series of Sherlock Holmes stories, which starred Sir John Gielgud as the famous consulting detective. Many fine actors of the British stage and screen were involved in individual episodes of the <i>Theatre Royal</i> series, such as Sir John Gielgud, Robert Morley, Harry Andrews, Muriel Forbes, Robert Donat, and Daphne Maddox. The music was credited to the renown British organist and arranger, Sidney Torch. However much of the same music was also used in other Harry Alan Towers productions on which Torch also worked, such as <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Secrets_Of_Scotland_Yard\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Secrets of Scotland Yard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Black_Museum\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Black Museum</a>, and <i>The Many Lives of Harry Lime</i>. So how much of it was actually written for this series will probably never be known. Harry Alan Towers produced and directed the show for his Towers of London company for international syndication, at the time in Europe, South Africa and Australia. The episodes included in this distribution are from the initial US run on NBC. However selected episodes were repeated, with a different series opening and close on the ABC Mystery Time series during the late 1950s. The show <i>Theatre Royal</i> remained in active syndication in the United States well up into the 1970s. Many of the copies in circulation today, come from those 1970s repeats where the individual episodes were cut to about 20 minutes. Luckily these cuts were made by the production company and generally do not take away from the actual program enjoyment. This reduced length comes from a combination for factors including removing dated introductory material from the beginning of the early episodes, making time for local stations to include hourly 5 minute newscasts and to insert commercials locally. In conclusion, this series consisted of new radio adaptations of famous, and not so famous stories by some of the best authors in the United States and England. It is the inclusion of some of those little known masterpieces by many familiar authors that gives the series a variety element usually missing in this type of anthology series. Its long syndication run, well into the 70s, proves once again classic stories presented by talented actors never really goes out of style. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

His quest to bring the killer to justice serves as the springboard to an unexpected new career as a crimefighting attorney struggling to bring order to his small corner of the frontier as it makes the difficult transition from the Old West to the New. Remington is played initially by Jeff Chandler, oddly billed here as \"Tex\" Chandler despite being at this time already an established star in both radio (<i>Our Miss Brooks</i>) and film (<i>Broken Arrow</i>). Halfway through the program's relatively short run, the role is assumed by another veteran actor, Reed Hadley. The obligatory Western sidekick is a hard-drinking gentleman of mixed blood called Cherokee O'Bannon, and is played by comedic character actor Wade Crosby, who chose to borrow W.C. Fields' voice for the purpose… with results perhaps best judged by the individual listener! <font size=\"-2\"></font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

The shoes were designed for children and so sponsoring a children's radio show seemed like a good idea. In 1937, they launched a syndicated children's serial named \"Cruise of the Poll Parrot\". The show was sold in thirteen segment blocks, and three complete blocks exist today. The shows exponentially boosted shoe sales, helping International compete against the leader in children's shoes: Buster Brown. The main character for the show was a 24 year old man from St. Louis, Missouri, named Marvin Miller. This was some of his first radio work. He was the voice for the main character, Captain Roy Dalton, the Master of the ship Poll Parrot, and also the voice of the parrot that was the pet of the Captain. Marvin Miller went on to work on hundreds of other radio shows, mostly as an announcer. He acted in a number of films, most notably in 1947 starring with Humphrey Bogart in \"Dead Reckoning\". Miller played a crooked gambler's sadistic henchman named Krause. He became most famous as Michael Anthony, the man who handed out the million dollar checks in the 1950s TV series, \"The Millionaire\". Miller died in Los Angeles of a heart attack in 1984 at the age of 71. The Cruise of the Poll Parrot takes place in 1858 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, center of the United States whaling industry. Besides Captain Roy Dalton, the cast included Ezra Grange, owner of the Poll Parrot, Ezra's little sister Sue, and her friend Johnny Robbins. Other characters on the show were first mate George Wainwright, a one legged sailor named Old Dickson, a muteness crew member named Red Mahooley, ship keeper Breckenridge, and El Testi who was an agent for another shipping company. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Cruise of the Poll Parrot <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>March 15, 2006 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Get in and out of danger. Donlevy had the voice and delivery to make the show sound plausible, even if it was routine Cold War brush fire stuff. Herb Butterfield was the Commissioner, a taskmaster shrouded in secrecy who served up the situations that Mitchell seems never to refuse. The Commissioner's secretary is played by Betty Moran. She actually seems to care about the Steve's welfare. The Commissioner is just concerned about the fare. The worldwide locations are dealt up with a feeling of local, and the characters that inhabit these faraway places with strange sounding names are solid and capably acted by veterans.

During the third season of <i>Monday Night At 8</i>, Ernest Dudley, an actor and writer, introduced his aloof, imperious criminologist, Dr. Morelle to the worldwide audience of the BBC. The <i>Monday Night At 8</i> segments featuring Dudley's character were called <i>Meet Dr. Morelle</i>, starring Dennis Arundell as Dr. Morelle and Morelle's assistant, Miss Frayle, was portrayed by Jane Grahame. Jane Grahame was also the wife of Ernest Dudley. Arundell and Grahame continued in the recurring roles between 1942 and 1946. During the 1947-1948 season appearances of <i>Meet Dr. Morelle</i>, Morelle was portrayed by Heron Carvic. Ernest Dudley went on to write five novels centered around his 'detective you love to hate,' and teamed with Arthur Watkyn to write a stage play, Dr. Morelle based on the character. Dudley reportedly conceived the character of Dr. Morelle while sitting in the coal cellar of his Bristol flat during Luftwaffe raids during the 1940s. He fully intended his character and his stories to have a light-hearted, humorous flavor. Fast forward to 1957 and Dudley's admittedly irritating sleuth was reintroduced in a thirteen-week comedy-detective drama, <i>A Case for Dr. Morelle</i>, featuring successful Film actor Cecil Parker as Dr. Morelle and Sheila Sim as Miss Frayle. Cecil Parker was truly inspired choice, having portrayed several Film characters with many of Dr. Morelle's irritating traits and studied aloofness. The programme was an instant hit in a perfect mating of actor to material. Dr. Morelle is reintroduced in the premiere episode by way of a chance meeting with his 'former' assistant Miss Frayle. Somewhat reminiscent of how Agatha Christie's character, Hercule Poirot, first met his Miss Lemon, Miss Frayle comes to Dr. Morelle hoping to enlist his interest in the problem of an acquaintance of hers. Dr. Morelle, as it transpires, is at loose ends having just lost his assistant of some years and spends as much in the first episode solving a murder as trying to woo Miss Frayle back as his assistant. The premiere episode, Alarm Call, also gives Cecil Parker an opportunity to establish his characterization of Dr. Morelle. Parker, a gifted international character actor, was at ease playing straight dramatic roles as light comedy and his light comedy background suits the characterization of Dr. Morelle to a tee. The format of the series follows the 'teaser' fashion by then popularized for some years over both Radio and Television, with a compelling preview portion of the script, followed by the theme music and announcement of the episode's title. Dr. Morelle is referred to as a Harley Street Doctor of Psychiatry, specializing in criminal psychology. Dr. Morelle is also possessed of an unshakeable confidence in his opinions, conclusions and psychological impressions of virtually everyone he meets. But he's not without eccentricities. By his own admission he's, for example, afraid of ascending stairs -- a self-described throwback to his childhood. <font size=\"-2\">From <a href=\"http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-A-Case-for-Dr-Morelle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Digital Deli Too</a>.</font> From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

The program was first broadcast in 1944 on the Mutual Network, and switched between that and NBC over the decade it was on the air. The show was originally sponsored by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, and later Miles Laboratories, Quaker Oats, Post Toasties and Dodge automobiles financed this popular evening western adventure. Roy Rogers, the \"King of the Cowboys\" in the movies, was the star. Naturally, his iconic steed Trigger played a big role on the series, as did Roy's group the Sons of the Pioneers, who originally provided the vocal music along with Roy and the lovely Pat Friday. A year later, Roy's new wife and co-star Dale Evans joined the program (along with her horse Buttermilk), as did the Riders of the Purple Sage and Foy Willing. Roy's comical sidekicks included former Sons of the Pioneers member Pat Brady and the legendary Gabby Hayes, as well as Forrest Lewis, who portrayed the wisest trail scout of them all, Jonah Wilde. The show was transcribed from the outset, as Roy's contractual obligations precluded him from performing live. The program's original opening theme was \"It's Round-Up Time on the Double-R-Bar\", which was also the name of Roy's fictional ranch in Paradise Valley on the series. This was later supplanted by the famous \"Happy Trails\" song, written by Dale Evans. Roy would often close the show, in reference to his Christian beliefs, with the phrase “Goodbye, good luck, and may the good Lord take a likin' to ya.” <font size=\"-2\">The information in this synopsis was culled from Radio's Golden Age by Vincent Terrace and On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio by John Dunning.</font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>The Roy Rogers Show <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>January 24, 2013 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>5 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

In 1980, the program moved to the Mutual Broadcasting System and became the Mutual Radio Theater. The Mutual series broadcast repeats from the CBS run until September 1980, when a short season of new dramas was presented. Sears continued as a sponsor during the Mutual run. Monday was \"Western Night\" and was hosted by Lorne Greene. Tuesday was \"Comedy Night\", hosted by Andy Griffith. Wednesday was \"Mystery Night\" with Vincent Price as host. Thursday was \"Love And Hate Night\" with Cicely Tyson doing honors as host.

With music by Robert Stringer, the show originated from New York during its first three months on the air, with Anthony Ross portraying Times Square Detective Danny Clover. John Dietz directed for producer Lester Gottlieb. Beginning with the July 7, 1949 episode, the series was broadcast from Hollywood with producer Elliott Lewis directing a new cast in scripts by Morton Fine and David Friedkin. The opening theme of \"I'll Take Manhattan\" introduced Detective Danny Clover (played by Larry Thor), a hardened New York City cop who worked homicide \"from Times Square to Columbus Circle -- the gaudiest, the most violent, the lonesomest mile in the world.\" Danny Clover narrated the tales of the Great White Way to the accompaniment of music by Wilbur Hatch and Alexander Courage, and the recreation of Manhattan's aural tapestry required the talents of three sound effects technicians (David Light, Ralph Cummings, Ross Murray). Bill Anders was the show's announcer. The supporting cast included regulars Charles Calvert (as Sgt. Gino Tartaglia) and Jack Kruschen (as Sgt. Muggavan), with episodic roles filled by such radio actors as Irene Tedrow, Barney Phillips, Lamont Johnson, Herb Ellis, Hy Averback, Edgar Barrier, Betty Lou Gerson, Harry Bartell, Sheldon Leonard, Martha Wentworth, Lawrence Dobkin and Mary Jane Croft. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

As many film actors were used to numerous takes and not live performance, they sometimes suffered acute stage fright before the show. However, since most received $5,000 for their performance â in addition to free publicity for upcoming pictures â actors appeared in their original screen roles if they were available. Indeed, production would halt if necessary on a film if performers were called to appear on Lux. When the actors were not available, others stepped in. The plays were assembled and rehearsed for a week, in sharp contrast to many other shows, which required a minimal of an actorâs time.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">SINGLES AND DOUBLES COLLECTION: A - C</font></b></u></i></p> This is a work in progress. This OTRR Collection is a Non-Certified one, containing series in which currently only one or two episodes are known to exist -- hence the name: \"Singles and Doubles Collection\". Almost every type genre is included. Radio -- called by some <i>The Theater of the Mind</i> -- has been with us since 1920 when stations WWJ of Detroit and KDKA of Pittsburg made the first regular commercial broadcasts. The first program aimed at entertaining the unseen audience followed close behind. Over the years since then, literally thousands of series have been broadcast nationally and thousands more in regional or local markets. Some endured for a few years, others for 20 or 30, and some unfortunately only had one episode broadcast. Of those thousands, some series saw some of their episodes saved for the future, some saw nearly all and others only one or two episodes. While the goal of the Old Time Radio Researchers Group is to preserve radios past by collecting, and archiving as many different series as possible and making them available to the community, we do not want to let the series that only had a minimum number of episodes to survive go unpreserved for future generations. To that end we have put together this unique collection of series. Most of the programs you will find here will be totally unfamilar to you, but they are informative and entertaining none the less. This is the second version of this collection that we have released. Since the first collection new broadcasts have surfaced, and others will undoubtely be found in the future. When and if that occurs, we will release a version three. From comedy to drama to cooking shows to music, you'll hear it all here, and every episode will be unique and different. They run the gamut, from the middle 20s to the early 70s, all showing us a glimpse of the past, when things were slower and families gathered round the radio each evening. Times when each person was hearing the same thing, but created a different picture in their minds of what the characters looked like, the scenery, location, and most important the sounds. Sounds that each found a different meaning in, but one that entertained, educated, and made the world a smaller place, where you could hear those stories that in the past were told to just a few, gathered round the dinner table, at a campfire, or in small audiences, but now the whole world could hear and enjoy. Some of these episodes may be misnamed or misdated. If you find such, please let us know. Additionally there may be some dead air space at the beginning or ending of some episodes. This is not one of our certified sets, it is being provided as a way to obtain those series in which only one or two shows have survived. This page contains Series beginning with the letters A through C. A text file containing a list of the MP3 files found on this page appears near the bottom of the page.

Ironically, the episode was titled \"Devil Stone\" and was the last dramatic radio play from a series that had its roots in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-time_radio\" rel=\"nofollow\">golden age of radio. </a>. What began as a \"new series frankly dedicated to your horrification and entertainment\" took on a life of its own mostly due to the talents of some outstanding producers and adaptations and original stories from the cream of mystery writers of the time. The golden age of radio was truly the golden age of <i>SUSPENSE</i> as show after show broadcast outstanding plays which were \"calculated to intrigue...stir [the] nerves.\" It was the series' first producer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Spier\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Spier</a>, who set the framework of rules that was to stay with the show for most of its run. Mr. Spier determined that the series should deal with life-and-death situations established near the beginning of each play and then through the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bernard_Herrmann</a>'s musical coloring and the writer's characterizations slowly tighten the knot of <i>SUSPENSE</i>. Many of the early stories were written by the mystery writer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dickson_Carr\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Dickson Carr</a>. Others were by such fine writers as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Fletcher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Fletcher</a>, whose <i>SUSPENSE</i> play, \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry,_Wrong_Number#Radio_play\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sorry, Wrong Number</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1943/Suspense_430525_043_Sorry_Wrong_Number_128-44_28100_29m17s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/download)</a> was turned into a major motion picture; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Arthur,_Jr.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Arthur</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Richards\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert L. Richards</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton_Fine\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morton Fine</a> and David Friedkin. The series also drew from the mystery writers of the day as well as the horror writers of literature; writers such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edgar Allan Poe</a> , <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft\" rel=\"nofollow\">H. P. Lovecraft</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Woolrich\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cornell Woolrich</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_L._Sayers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dorothy L. Sayers</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells\" rel=\"nofollow\">H. G. Wells</a>. Many of the stories produced by Mr. Spier are now classics of the genre. Listen to the likes of \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_in_Cypress_Canyon\" rel=\"nofollow\">The House in Cypress Canyon</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1946/Suspense_461205_222_The_House_in_Cypress_Canyon_128-44_28764_30m20s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/downoad)</a> as a young couple encounters something in the closet of their new home, something horrible and dangerous; or \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitch-Hiker_%28radio_play%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">The_Hitch-Hiker</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1942/Suspense_420902_011_The_Hitch-Hiker_128-44_29227_30m50s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/download)</a> in which a man driving cross-country seems to be haunted by an ominous figure, who keeps reappearing trying to get a ride. But what foreboding does the hitchhiker hold for the driver? Another rule William Spier established was to make the series a place to hear the talents of Hollywood's famous actors. There rarely was a famous actor who did not appear on the series at some time. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Stewart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jimmy_Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cary Grant</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Humphrey Bogart</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Ball</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olivia de Havilland</a> and many others all made at least one appearance. The series had a generous budget from its network, CBS. In 1948 the series had become popular enough that it was decided to broadcast for a complete hour, instead of the former thirty minutes. The actor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_%28actor%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Montgomery</a> was brought in to introduce the plays, replacing the \"Man in Black\" character and occasionally star in them. This format lasted only six months most probably due to the realization that the show worked best within a thirty minute framework. It was at this time that William Spier left and over the years others came to produce the shows, each setting his own unique mark. Anton M. Leader, who came from producing another horror radio program, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_at_Midnight_%28radio_series%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Murder_at_Midnight</a>, added some lighter <i>SUSPENSE</i> stories which focused more on the central characters. Jimmy Stewart appeared in an excellent story about a paralysed war veteran who thinks he has found the man who imprisoned and tortured him. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fibber McGee and Molly</a> appeared in a tale about a killer on the loose in \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1949/Suspense_490203_326_Backseat_Driver_128-44_28499_30m03s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backseat Driver</a>.\" Probably the biggest change in <i>SUSPENSE</i> came under the producing eye of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Lewis_%28radio%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elliott Lewis</a>. Lewis brought in comic actors to play serious roles. Actors such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Benny\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Benny</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Skelton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Skelton</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzie_Nelson\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ozzie Nelson</a>. He also was not afraid to experiment using the series slot for classic \"murder\" stories such as \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello\" rel=\"nofollow\">Othello</a>.\" The series continued to produce high-quality drama, though there were many repeats as well as borrowing of scripts from other radio shows. While a number of film actors continued to star occasionally, many of the stars were from radio and television since radio as a dramatic art form was beginning to lose its popularity and budgets were tightened. The show was on the air for a little over twenty years beginning in January, 1942 and was rarely pre-empted. There were 947 performances. Nearly all (approximately 895) are available to collectors. When <i>SUSPENSE</i> left the air, radio was never to see the likes of such a series again. Now the great medium of radio where imagination can run free has been reduced to the occasional brilliant drama airing sporadically in some corner of the world. <i>SUSPENSE</i> was a golden moment in a golden age. A moment when the thrill of the nightime led the listener along the path of intrigue, horror and dangerous adventure.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">ADVENTURES OF PHILIP MARLOWE</font></b></u></i></p> Elements of mystery have always been represented in literature, but the detective story didn't arrive on the scene until the mid 1800's. Edgar Allan Poe's The Murders in the Rue Morgue, published in 1841, was the first. The Murder's main character, C. Auguste Dupin, was a brilliant detective who relied on superior deductive powers to solve the crime. He and his unnamed narrator companion solved this and two other mysteries. Later in the 19th century Sir Arthur Conan Doyle expanded on Poe's new concept in his Sherlock Holmes stories. Many think that Doyle patterned Holmes and Watson after Dupin and his friend. The Sherlock Holmes stories were wildly popular in England, and after Conan Doyle, the British continued to dominate the detective genre with other detectives who depended on keen observation and deductive logic to solve crimes. These detectives most commonly applied their brilliance to crimes in quaint country houses outside small idyllic villages. Then, in the 1930's and 1940's American writers added a grittier urban element to the detective genre -- the hardboiled detective. As opposed to the typical British detective, the hardboiled detective was generally a cynical loner with a strong sense of justice that wasn't necessarily limited to that provided by the court system. Instead of country houses, these detectives were more likely to be found in shady all-night bars or on the mean streets of Los Angeles, Chicago, or New York City. Dashiell Hammett introduced the new genre, and Sam Spade, in 1930 in his novel The Maltese Falcon. A few years later Raymond Chandler came along and perfected the type, with his detective, Philip Marlowe. Chandler introduced Marlowe in his first novel, The Big Sleep, and Philip Marlowe continued to solve crimes in six subsequent Chandler novels. Chandler had previously published a number of short stories featuring other detectives; however, Marlowe proved so popular that when the stories were later republished the author often switched the detectives to Philip Marlowe. Chandler's style was unique. His sparse style was full of wonderfully sharp similies and rich descriptive narration. Here's an example from The Little Sister: <blockquote> \"I put the duster away folded with the dust in it, leaned back and just sat, not smoking, not even thinking. I was a blank man. I had no face, no meaning, no personality, hardly a name. I didn't want to eat. I didn't even want a drink. I was the page from yesterday's calendar crumpled at the bottom of the waste basket.\" </blockquote> And another from The High Window: <blockquote> \"Then he picked the glass up and tasted it and sighed again and shook his head sideways with a half smile; the way a man does when you give him a drink and he needs it very badly and it is just right and the first swallow is like a peek into a cleaner, sunnier, brighter world.\" </blockquote> Marlowe was a more complex character than some of his hard boiled brethren. Sure he could handle a gun and take a beating. But, he was more than just a tough guy, he had gone to college, could play chess, and appreciated classical music. He also had his own strong ethical standards and turned down jobs that didn't measure up to those standards. By the late 1940's Marlowe had moved to the big screen, with Marlowe played by Dick Powell, Robert Mitchum, and Humphrey Bogart. One of those movies, Murder My Sweet, was responsible for Marlowe's first appearance on radio when it was presented on <i>Lux Radio Theatre</i> on June 11, 1945 starring Dick Powell and Clair Trevor. In April, 1947 the New York Times announced that the summer replacement for Bob Hope would be a new adventure-mystery series, <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i>. Airing on NBC at 10:00 p.m. on June 17th, the show starred Van Heflin with a script by Milton Geiger based on the stories of Raymond Chandler. Most radio shows had live audiences in the studio. The Philip Marlowe producers decided against the common practice because they thought audiences might detract from the show. However 19 of Los Angeles' top detectives were in the studio during the airing of the first show. No one knows what the detectives thought of the production, but according to the New York Times review, Van Heflin did well but struggled with an awkward script. The reviewer thought the show depended too much on straight narration at dramatic moments instead of action or dialog. \"Leaving ones play in the wings, as they say on Broadway, always makes for disconcerting theatre, and this was painfully true in the case of <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i>.\" Raymond Chandler wasn't enthralled by the show either. In a letter to Earl Stanley Gardner, author of the Perry Mason novels, Mr. Chandler said \"It was thoroughly flat.\" This initial run of <i>Philip Marlowe</i> went from June 17 to September 19, 1947, with Pepsodent as the sponsor. The announcer was Wendell Niles, music was by Lyn Murray, and the producer was Jim Fonda. After the summer run ended, NBC dropped the show. As far as we know, only four episodes of this series have survived. The character of Philip Marlowe was too good to stay off stage for long though. A year later CBS decided to take a chance on reviving the show. Norman Macdonnell was producer/director; Gene Levitt, Robert Mitchell, Mel Dinelli, and Kathleen Hite wrote the scripts; and Richard Aurandt was responsible for the music. CBS cast Gerald Mohr to star as Philip Marlowe, with Roy Rowan as announcer. Philip Marlowe, being a loner, was really the only regular character, but throughout the three years the series ran a long string of high-quality supporting Hollywood actors appeared on the show. Performing alongside Mohr at various times were Jeff Corey, Howard McNear, Parley Baer, Lawrence Dobkin, Virginia Gregg, Gloria Blondell, and Lou Krugman. The CBS production ran from September 26, 1948 to September 29, 1950 with an additional short summer run from July 7 to September 15, 1951. This revival of <i>Philip Marlowe</i> was more favorably received, probably because of a combination of writing and acting. No one could duplicate the writing of Raymond Chandler, but this group of writers was very good. While Chandler's distinctive similes were largely lacking, the strong dry, sarcastic narration was there, and the way Gerald Mohr delivered the lines had a way of making you forget that they weren't written by Chandler. Mr. Mohr seemed born for the part of the cynical detective. His voice and timing were perfect for the character. In a letter to Gene Levitt, one of the show's writers, Raymond Chandler commented that a voice like Gerald Mohr's at least packed personality; a decided an improvement over his opinion of the original show. By 1949 the show had the largest audience in radio. CBS capitalized on the popularity of <i>Philip Marlowe</i> to introduce a look-alike show a few months later, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Yours_Truly_Johnny_Dollar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</a>. During the period both shows were broadcast, Johnny Dollar played second fiddle to the popular Philip Marlowe. Even after Marlowe went off the air in 1951, Dollar remained an average detective show. That was to end Oct 3, 1955 when <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Yours_Truly_Johnny_Dollar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</a> changed everything; the writers, the format to 15 minutes and the lead actor. The new 15 minute episodes staring Bob Bailey dominated detective/mystery drama from then until its last broadcast, September 30, 1962. That date and that broadcast are generally considered as the last of the radio drama broadcasts. <i>Philip Marlowe</i> continued to find limited success in the movies and television in America and England after his radio career ended. Several quality presentations of Chandler's character were produced by the BBC in the 1990's. But the death of Chandler's wife pulled him into severe depression and put an end any effective writing. His last unfinished book, Poodle Springs, was finished by Robert B. Parker, a good friend who tried to remain faithful to the Chandler style. Unfortunately, the critics did not agree. Philip Marlowe, the gritty, no nonsense American detective lived and vanished from the quill of a writer raised in Europe. He will remain a classic buried in the modern world of fighting crime with technology. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>April 8, 2007 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>3 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Consisting of thirteen 15 minute episodes, it was provided to local Rotary Clubs for broadcast on local stations. In conjunction, thirteen discussion scripts were also offered to be used as follow-up broadcasts or for use as program and educational material where local broadcast might not be possible. Broadcast from March 1, 1955 through March 18, 1955, five times a week. Each episode featured a different situation involving persons with a problem, with the solution being provided by the Rotary Club. Typical of the recordings is “Youth, Yesterday and Today”. Originally broadcast on March 15, 1955, it deals with a former convict who gathers a gang of underprivileged youths and trains them to steal automobile accessories. Through a Rotarian druggist, through whom one of the young men is employed, the Rotary Club becomes aware of the situation, finds a way to appeal to the boy’s better nature, and through a series of highly dramatic sequences, the Rotary Club helps the police catch the former convict. The program ends with many of the boys being rehabilitated and finding lives of useful purpose. The program may seem to be dated, but the moral implications come across loud and clear.

The stories Chet relates to us are all quite fanciful. They deal with topics that would be classified supernatural and science fiction. They border on outrageous but that is how they are meant to be. Roughly half of the shows feature a nice, likeable, rural southern manure hauler by the name of Elmer Korn who always finds himself involved in some inane predicament. The creators of the series themselves admit the show is rather off-beat but, you will find, not without it’s own charm which lies within the humorous writing and the recurring characters. This series was created and produced by M&J Audio Theater. The M stands for Mark Sawyer and the J is for Jay Reel. Two childhood friends who met in the 6th grade in 1977 with a tape recorder that had a mutual interest in radio drama as influenced by old time radio shows such as <i>X Minus One</i>, <i>Lum and Abner</i>, and <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Gunsmoke\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gunsmoke</a>. One can hear these influences in every story from the subject matter and the character voices, to the plots. The creaking door opening, the host’s oddly humorous manner and the “pleasant dreams” ending are an undeniable salute to <i>The Inner Sanctum</i> and Himan Brown. Between the two of them, Mark and Jay collaborate to do over 20 characters in these stories. Jay is the voice of Chet Chetter, Elmer Corn, the Sherrif, Roland, and Gale Headrush Taylor. Mark only admits to being the voice of Cecil Farris and incidental characters. Mark and Jay produced the first Chet Chetter story, \"The Highway of Death\" in 1989. It was born from a series of 95 episodes which they did over a period of years from 1980 to 1995. They call it \"The Conofrof Saga\". They submitted \"The Highway of Death\" to National Public Radio and were amazed when NPR responded with an order for 3 more stories. The 4 episodes were accepted and broadcast on NPR Playhouse in 1990. The following year NPR ordered 9 more installments of <i>Tales From the Morgue</i> to be broadcast as a complete 13 show series in 1992. There were a total of 19 shows produced but 6 were rejected by NPR. M and J are quick to point out that rejection by NPR has no bearing on the quality of the show. The rejections merely reflect the stringent guidelines NPR had for broadcast content at the time. During the 90’s <i>Tales From the Morgue</i> proved so popular that it aired internationally in Australia and England. Some episodes were featured three times on Sue Zizza’s Radio Works including one non-morgue show The Spirit of 76 Marina Hootin’ Nanny. Mark and Jay developed a new series called M&J Presents due largely to feeling creatively stifled by NPR’s rigid standards. With their new series there were no rules, no restrictions. Anything could be done and was. The shows varied in content and story lines. For them it was more like a miscellaneous collection from the M&J archives. Unfortunately M&J Audio Theater has not produced any new material in over 10 years at the time of this writing but don’t count them out. They have the same love for theater of the mind as we do and both Mark and Jay would fervently like to return to it at some point. At present Mark and Jay are co-directing, producing, writing and editing a movie based on the first episode of Chet Chetter, \"The Highway of Death\". <font size=\"1\">Information was supplied by Mark Sawyer, co-creator of <i>Chet Chetter's Tales From the Morgue</i>.</font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

During the third season of <i>Monday Night At 8</i>, Ernest Dudley, an actor and writer, introduced his aloof, imperious criminologist, Dr. Morelle to the worldwide audience of the BBC. The <i>Monday Night At 8</i> segments featuring Dudley's character were called <i>Meet Dr. Morelle</i>, starring Dennis Arundell as Dr. Morelle and Morelle's assistant, Miss Frayle, was portrayed by Jane Grahame. Jane Grahame was also the wife of Ernest Dudley. Arundell and Grahame continued in the recurring roles between 1942 and 1946. During the 1947-1948 season appearances of <i>Meet Dr. Morelle</i>, Morelle was portrayed by Heron Carvic. Ernest Dudley went on to write five novels centered around his 'detective you love to hate,' and teamed with Arthur Watkyn to write a stage play, Dr. Morelle based on the character. Dudley reportedly conceived the character of Dr. Morelle while sitting in the coal cellar of his Bristol flat during Luftwaffe raids during the 1940s. He fully intended his character and his stories to have a light-hearted, humorous flavor. Fast forward to 1957 and Dudley's admittedly irritating sleuth was reintroduced in a thirteen-week comedy-detective drama, <i>A Case for Dr. Morelle</i>, featuring successful Film actor Cecil Parker as Dr. Morelle and Sheila Sim as Miss Frayle. Cecil Parker was truly inspired choice, having portrayed several Film characters with many of Dr. Morelle's irritating traits and studied aloofness. The programme was an instant hit in a perfect mating of actor to material. Dr. Morelle is reintroduced in the premiere episode by way of a chance meeting with his 'former' assistant Miss Frayle. Somewhat reminiscent of how Agatha Christie's character, Hercule Poirot, first met his Miss Lemon, Miss Frayle comes to Dr. Morelle hoping to enlist his interest in the problem of an acquaintance of hers. Dr. Morelle, as it transpires, is at loose ends having just lost his assistant of some years and spends as much in the first episode solving a murder as trying to woo Miss Frayle back as his assistant. The premiere episode, Alarm Call, also gives Cecil Parker an opportunity to establish his characterization of Dr. Morelle. Parker, a gifted international character actor, was at ease playing straight dramatic roles as light comedy and his light comedy background suits the characterization of Dr. Morelle to a tee. The format of the series follows the 'teaser' fashion by then popularized for some years over both Radio and Television, with a compelling preview portion of the script, followed by the theme music and announcement of the episode's title. Dr. Morelle is referred to as a Harley Street Doctor of Psychiatry, specializing in criminal psychology. Dr. Morelle is also possessed of an unshakeable confidence in his opinions, conclusions and psychological impressions of virtually everyone he meets. But he's not without eccentricities. By his own admission he's, for example, afraid of ascending stairs -- a self-described throwback to his childhood. <font size=\"-2\">From <a href=\"http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-A-Case-for-Dr-Morelle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Digital Deli Too</a>.</font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>A Case for Dr Morelle <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>March 15, 2013 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

Johnny was an accomplished 'padder' of his expense account. The name of the show derives from the fact that he closed each show by totaling his expense account, and signing it \"End of report... Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\". Terry Salomonson in his authoritative \"A Radio Broadcast Log of the Drama Program Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", notes that the original working title was \"Yours Truly, Lloyd London\". Salomonson writes \"Lloyd London was scratched out of the body of (the Dick Powell) audition script and Johnny Dollar was written in. Thus the show was re-titled on this script and the main character was renamed. Why this was done was unclear â possibly to prevent a legal run-in with Lloydâs of London Insurance Company.\" Although based in Hartford, Connecticut, the insurance capital of the world, freelancer Johnny Dollar managed to get around quite a bit â his adventures taking him all over the world. There were some unusual devices used in the show that help set it apart from other shows. There was no partner, assistant, or secretary for Johnny. The character closest to a continuing role was that of Pat McCracken of the Universal Adjustment Bureau, who assigned Johnny many of his cases. Another atypical aspect gave the show additional credibility â frequently, characters on the show would mention that they had heard about Johnnyâs cases on the radio. Johnny often used his time when filling out his expense accounts to give the audience background information or to express his thoughts about the current case. No fewer than eight actors played Johnny Dollar. Dick Powell, of <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Rogues_Gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogueâs Gallery</a> fame, cut the original audition tape, but chose to do <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Richard_Diamond_Private_Detective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Diamond, Private Detective</a> instead. Gerald Mohr, of <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i> fame, auditioned in 1955, prior to Bob Bailey getting the title role. Through the first three actors to play Johnny Dollar (Charles Russell, Edmond O'Brien, and John Lund), there was little to distinguish the series from many other radio detective series. Dollar was just another hard-boiled detective in a medium that was overloaded with the stereotype. Charles Russell, the first to play the role, would throw silver dollars to bellboys and waiters. Luckily, this trite gimmick did not survive long. On October 3, 1955, after a hiatus of over a year, the show came back with a vengeance. A new production team, including director/writer Jack Johnstone, a new star, Bob Bailey, from the radio series <i>Let George Do It</i>, and a new format would set the series apart from its competitors. Johnny's cases were now a continuing serial, five days a week, for fifteen minutes each evening. With 75 minutes of airtime, minus commercials and openings and closings, there was sufficient time to develop good storylines and interesting characters. During this time, <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> attracted some of the best writers in Hollywood, including Jack Johnstone, E. Jack Neuman (using the pen name John Dawson), Robert Ryf, and Les Crutchfield. Bob Bailey also wrote a script while he was playing Johnny Dollar. He used the pen name Robert Bainter (Bainter was his middle name) as the scriptwriter for \"The Carmen Kringle Matter\", which was aired on Saturday, December 21, 1957 on the West Coast, and on the following day for the rest of the country. Bob Bailey, generally thought of as the most popular of the Johnny Dollars, brought a new interpretation to the character â tough, but not hard-boiled; streetwise, but not overly cynical, Bailey's Dollar was smart and gritty when he had to be. But Bailey's Johnny Dollar was also human. His character would get emotionally involved in a number of his cases. He had a streak of impatience, and would occasionally not fully listen to a witness and rush off on a tangent before realizing his mistake. The weekday serialized episodes are generally acknowledged as some of the finest radio detective shows ever produced. There were fifty six multi-part shows in all: fifty four five-part shows, one six-part show, and one nine-part show. The serialized episodes continued until November 2, 1956 when the series again reverted to a once a week, thirty minute format. Bob Bailey continued in the lead, until \"The Empty Threat Matter\" of November 27, 1960, when the Hollywood run ended. The guest stars and supporting casts were always first rate, attracting the best radio actors in both Los Angeles and New York. Pat McCracken was played by several actors â most frequently, by Larry Dobkin. Particularly noteworthy was the work of Virginia Gregg, who played many roles, including Johnny's girlfriend Betty Lewis. Harry Bartell was also a frequent guest, who did many of the Spanish dialect roles when Johnny went to a Latin American country. Other frequent guest performers were Parley Baer, Tony Barrett, John Dehner, Don Diamond, Sam Edwards, Herb Ellis, Frank Gerstle, Stacy Harris, Jack Kruschen, Forrest Lewis, Howard McNear, Marvin Miller, Jeanette Nolan, Vic Perrin, Barney Phillips, Jean Tatum, Russell Thomson, Ben Wright, and Will Wright. Vincent Price co-starred as himself in \"The Price of Fame Matter\" and went to Europe with Johnny on the case. In December 1960, the show moved to New York. Robert Readick started the New York run as Dollar, but only lasted a short while. Jack Johnstone continued to write for the show and submitted scripts from California. Johnstone wrote about 350 Johnny Dollar scripts under his own name and his pen names Sam Dawson and Jonathan Bundy. Johnstone wrote the last episodes of both <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> and <i>Suspense</i>. He used the Bundy pen name when writing the last <i>Suspense</i> episode, \"Devilstone\". And so, an era passed. <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> was the last continuing detective series of the Golden Age of Radio. Mandel Kramer was the last Johnny Dollar, and a close second in popularity to Bailey, when the final episode, \"The Tip-Off Matter\", was aired on September 30, 1962. <font size=\"1\">Material for this description was prepared by Stewart Wright.</font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Jungles and deserts made up the eerie background sounds of the series that featured Don Douglas as John Steele. John Steele was the type of roving adventurer and thrill seeker who held various jobs in exotic locations. Among his career paths were country sheriff, special agent in Turkey and a ship's captain. The stories were narrated by a friend of Steele's, with Steele making cameo appearances throughout. Ted Mallie, of <i>The Shadow</i> and <i>I Love a Mystery</i> announcing fame also landed the job of the announcer for <i>John Steele, Adventurer</i>, which featured Elliot Drake as the director. John Larkin, Jack Edwards, Bryna Raeburn and other radio personalities were also featured in the series as supporting actors. Music for the series added tones of mystery and adventure and was produced by Sylvan Levin and later, Doc Whipple. Fans of the <i>John Steele, Adventurer</i> enjoyed the hard and fast-paced action and the stories seemed to be lifted off the pages from popular action magazines of the time such as All-Story and Argosy. To overcome the challenges of a radio show featuring a person who couldn't speak, the producers represented the boy's thoughts (rather than speaking voice) by using an echo chamber. It was considered a very moving and adventurous story of the series. At the end of each story in the series, John Steele's voice would comment, \"A life of adventure is yours for the asking, but don't look for it; it may find you! Happy hunting!\" <i>John Steele, Adventurer</i> made lots of fans during its time on the air and even though its overall rating wasn't as high as other radio shows it was very entertaining.

This OTRR Collection is a Non-Certified one, containing series in which currently only one or two episodes are known to exist -- hence the name: \"Singles and Doubles Collection\". Almost every type genre is included. Radio -- called by some <i>The Theater of the Mind</i> -- has been with us since 1920 when stations WWJ of Detroit and KDKA of Pittsburg made the first regular commercial broadcasts. The first program aimed at entertaining the unseen audience followed close behind. Over the years since then, literally thousands of series have been broadcast nationally and thousands more in regional or local markets. Some endured for a few years, others for 20 or 30, and some unfortunately only had one episode broadcast. Of those thousands, some series saw some of their episodes saved for the future, some saw nearly all and others only one or two episodes. While the goal of the Old Time Radio Researchers Group is to preserve radios past by collecting, and archiving as many different series as possible and making them available to the community, we do not want to let the series that only had a minimum number of episodes to survive go unpreserved for future generations. To that end we have put together this unique collection of series. Most of the programs you will find here will be totally unfamilar to you, but they are informative and entertaining none the less. This is the second version of this collection that we have released. Since the first collection new broadcasts have surfaced, and others will undoubtely be found in the future. When and if that occurs, we will release a version three. From comedy to drama to cooking shows to music, you'll hear it all here, and every episode will be unique and different. They run the gamut, from the middle 20s to the early 70s, all showing us a glimpse of the past, when things were slower and families gathered round the radio each evening. Times when each person was hearing the same thing, but created a different picture in their minds of what the characters looked like, the scenery, location, and most important the sounds. Sounds that each found a different meaning in, but one that entertained, educated, and made the world a smaller place, where you could hear those stories that in the past were told to just a few, gathered round the dinner table, at a campfire, or in small audiences, but now the whole world could hear and enjoy. Some of these episodes may be misnamed or misdated. If you find such, please let us know. Additionally there may be some dead air space at the beginning or ending of some episodes. This is not one of our certified sets, it is being provided as a way to obtain those series in which only one or two shows have survived.

From September, 1949 through February 1957, <i>Dragnet</i>'s 30 minute shows, broadcast on NBC, brought to radio true police stories in a low-key, documentary style. The origins of <i>Dragnet</i> can be traced to a semi-documentary film, \"He Walked by Night\" from 1948, in which Webb had a small role. Both employed the same Los Angeles Police Department technical adviser, used actual police cases and presented the case in \"just the facts\" manner that became a hallmark of <i>Dragnet</i>. It is interesting to note that Webb employed that format in other radio series, some pre-dating the film mentioned above. <i>Dragnet</i> was a long running radio and television police procedural drama, about the cases of a dedicated Los Angeles police detective, Sergeant Joe Friday, and his partners. The show takes its name from an actual police term, a <i>Dragnet</i>, meaning a system of coordinated measures for apprehending criminals or suspects. <i>Dragnet</i> was perhaps the most famous and influential police procedural drama in American media history. The series gave millions of Americans a feel for the boredom and drudgery, as well as the danger and heroism, of real life police work. <i>Dragnet</i> earned praise for improving the public opinion of police officers. Actor and producer Jack Webb's aims in <i>Dragnet</i> were for realism and unpretentious acting. He achieved both goals and <i>Dragnet</i> remains a key influence on subsequent police dramas in many media. The shows cultural impact is demonstrated by the fact that even after five decades, elements of <i>Dragnet</i> are known to those who have never heard nor seen the program. The ominous four note introduction to the brass and tympani theme music, titled <i>Danger Ahead</i>, is instantly recognizable as well as the shows opening narration: <blockquote> <i>\"Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to hear is true. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent.\"</i> </blockquote> The original <i>Dragnet</i> starring Jack Webb as Sergeant Joe Friday ran on radio from June 3rd, 1949 to February 26th, 1957; and on television from December 16th, 1951 to August 23rd, 1959, and from January 12th, 1967 to April 16th, 1970. All of these versions ran on NBC. There were two <i>Dragnet</i> feature films, a straight adaptation starring Jack Webb in 1954, and a comedy spoof in 1987. There were also television revivals, without Webb, in 1989 and 2003. <i>Dragnet</i> debuted inauspiciously. The first several months were bumpy, as Webb and company worked out the program's format and eventually became comfortable with their characters. Friday was originally portrayed as more brash and forceful than his later usually relaxed demeanor. Gradually, Friday's deadpanned, fast-talking persona emerged, described by John Dunning as \"a cop's cop: tough, but not hard; conservative, but caring\". Friday's first partner was Sergeant Ben Romero, portrayed by Barton Yarborough, a long time radio actor When <i>Dragnet</i> hit its stride, it became one of radio's top rated shows. Webb insisted on realism in every aspect of the show. The dialogue was clipped, understated, and sparse -- influenced by the hard-boiled school of crime fiction. Scripts were fast moving, but didn't seem rushed. Every aspect of police work was chronicled, step-by-step. From patrols and paperwork, to crime scene investigation, lab work and questioning witnesses or suspects. Webb was a stickler for accurate details, and <i>Dragnet</i> used many authentic touches, such as LAPD's actual radio call sign, KMA-367, and the names of many real department officials, such as Ray Pinker and Lee Jones of the Crime Lab, or Chief of Detectives, Thad Brown. Two announcers were used. Episodes began with announcer George Fennemen intoning the series opening: <blockquote> <i>\"The story you are about to hear is true. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent.\"</i> </blockquote> Hal Gibney described the basic premise of the episode. For example, \"Big Saint\", from April 26th, 1951, begins with: <blockquote> <i>\"You're a detective sergeant. You're assigned to auto theft detail. A well organized ring of car thieves begins operations in your city. It's one of the most puzzling cases you've ever encountered. Your job -- break it.\"</i> </blockquote> The story usually began with footsteps and a door closing, followed by Joe Friday intoning something like: <blockquote> <i>\"Tuesday, February 12th. It was cold in Los Angeles. We were working the day watch out of Robbery Division. My partner's Ben Romero. The boss is Ed Backstrom, Chief of Detectives. My name's Friday.\"</i> </blockquote> Friday offered voice-over narration throughout the episodes, noting the time, date, and place of every scene as he and his partners went through their day investigating the crime. The events related in a given episode might occur in a few hours or might span a few months. At least one episode unfolded in real time, in \"City Hall Bombing\", from July 21st, 1949. Friday and Romero had less than 30 minutes to stop a man who was threatening to destroy the City Hall with a bomb. At the end of an episode, announcer Hal Gibney would relate the fate of the suspect. They were usually convicted of a crime, and sent to the state penitentiary or a state mental hospital. Murderers were often executed in the manner proscribed by law. Occasionally, police pursued the wrong suspect, and criminals sometimes avoided justice, or escaped, at least on the radio version of <i>Dragnet</i>. Scripts tackled a number of topics, ranging from the thrilling (murders, missing persons, and armed robbery) to the mundane (check fraud and shoplifting) -- yet, <i>Dragnet</i> made them all interesting due to the fast moving plots and behind the scenes realism. In \"The Garbage Chute\", from December 15th, 1949, they even had a locked-room mystery. Though rather tame by modern standards, <i>Dragnet</i>, especially on the radio, handled controversial subjects, such as sex crimes and drug addiction, with unprecedented and even startling realism. The tone was usually serious, but there were moments of comic relief. Romero was something of a hypochondriac, and often seemed hen-pecked. Though Friday dated women, he usually dodged those who tried to set him up with marriage-minded dates. Due in part to Webb's fondness for radio drama, <i>Dragnet</i> persisted on radio until 1957, as one of the last old time radio shows to give way to television's increasing popularity. In fact, the TV show would prove to be effectively a visual version of the radio show, as the style was virtually the same. The TV show could be listened to, without watching it, with no loss of understanding of the storyline. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

He was named Børge Rosenbaum, and his musical talent was no surprise as his father was a musician in the Royal Danish Chapel. He was educated at the Royal Danish Academy of Music by Olivo Krause, and later by Victor Schiøler, Frederic Lamond and Egon Petri. He had his piano debut in 1926 at \"Odd Fellow Palæet\" in Copenhagen and was recognized as a very talented musician. During the 1930's he became one of Denmark's most popular artists. He started his career as a classical pianist, but his talent for making the audience laugh was soon obvious, and he started developing his unique blend of humor and music. He had his revue debut in 1933 and his film debut in 1937. In 1940 he was forced to leave Denmark, and he traveled from Petsano to New York. Although he didn't speak English he soon managed to \"translate\" his humor, and he performed for the first time in Bing Crosby's radio show in 1941. In 1942 he was pronounced \"the best new radio performer of the year\" by the American press, and his radio and TV shows became extremely popular. He became an American citizen in 1948, and had his own show, \"Comedy in Music\", at The Golden Theatre, New York 1953-56. He had performed as soloist and conductor with leading orchestras from 1956, and has performed as Opera Conductor, e.g. Magic Flute, Cleveland Orchestra, 1979 and The Royal Danish Theatre, 1992. He established several trusts, and he received numerous honorable awards and honors. He was the patron of The Danish Royal Academy of Music Children’s Choir. With Robert Sherman he was the author of My Favorite Intermissions (1971) and My Favorite Comedies in Music (1981). Victor Borge died at home in his sleep, December 23rd, 2000. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">Updated with Version 2 Files on 16-Feb-2009</font></b></i></p> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">POLICE REPORTER</font></b></u></i></p> Based on true crime stories, \"The Police Reporter\" was a fifteen minute dramatic series syndicated by Radio Release Limited. The earliest listing found for it was in the December 10, 1933 issue of the \"New York Times\" where it showed up on WEAF's program grid on Friday, December 15, 1933 at 10:00 pm. There are also several listings in the \"Los Angeles Times\" in February and March 1936 for a fifteen minute \"Police Reporter\" program on KGPJ at 8:00 pm. The company that produced the series, Radio Release Limited is listed in the 1934 edition of \"The Writer's Market\", noting that they're \"looking for anything with commercial value and will consider good scripts carefully. Pays good rates\". The company is also listed in the 1935 edition of \"Broadcasting: Yearbook-Marketbook Issue\" on page 122. \"The Police Reporter\" is a quarter hour drama that might remind you a bit of \"Front Page Drama\" in its sensationalism and melodrama. What makes the series unique is that all the stories featured are true. \"Gangbusters\", the pioneering \"true crime\" series of the period, premiered in July 1935 on NBC as \"G-Men\" according to Wikipedia. So, \"The Police Reporter\" pre-dates the more famous network show by a couple of years - if not the first, it could be one of the earliest true crime shows on the air. Program 1 of the series is about a man who has been missing for four days. A neighbor calls the police, thinking something may be wrong. It's the Lincoln murder case, which occurred in Aurora, Illinois in 1923. The program includes an announcement that this is the first program of the series. The series uses real names, dates and locations, so it's easy to track down information on the real cases dramatized on many of the programs. There was a detailed May 13, 2007 newspaper article from the Aurora Beacon News about the murder. There are 26 shows in the distribution and they are digitized directly from a set of original transcription discs. <font size=\"-2\"></font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Police Reporter <b>Certification Status: </b>Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>January 11, 2011 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

People often wonder how daredevils get that way and if they are normal human beings or suicidal maniacs. They are as normal as you and I and have no intent of self-destruction. With a yen for accomplishing what to many appears to be impossible in the way of daring feats, they have entered a bizarre profession where the money is good and they satisfy a public willing to pay for chills and thrills. But why pay to watch daredevils to perform? If you’ve got a television set in your home, sit back, relax, and get your share of thrills and chills watching the old adventure movies frequently shown, and, of course, the ever popular westerns. Look closely and you’re liable to see Yakima Canutt, perform his specialty of jumping from a stagecoach, onto the rear two animals of a six-horse team, then jump to the next two, and then up to the first two. Then Canutt, who usually gets $1,000 for this stunt, utters a prayer under his breath and then drops to the ground. Sure. You’ve seen this stunt a dozen times. Canutt allows the six-horse team thunder past him, then, as the wagon goes thundering past his body, he grabs the rear of the stagecoach and pulls himself up to the top. Many movies contain daring flying sequences staged by the king of the movie stunt pilots, Frank Clarke, who, before his death in 1948 from a plane accident not connected to any movie daredevilry, could make a plane do everything except eat out of his hand. And there were many other stunt daredevils, both men and women, who made the movie business exciting. In this series, you’ll hear many of their stories. We hope that you’ll enjoy them. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>The Daredevils of Hollywood <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>March 6, 2009 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

He cast his wife, Natalie Parks, in the title role of this sassy, sexy PI. Her understated love interest, Lt. Ray Mallard, was played by Henry Leff while her assistant and best pal, aptly named Rembrandt Watson, was the voice of Jack Thomas. Every show opened with a ringing telephone and our lady PI answering it with \"Candy Matson, YU 2-8209\" and then the organ swung into the theme song, \"Candy\". Each job took Candy from her apartment on Telegraph Hill into some actual location in San Francisco. The writers, overseen by Monty, worked plenty of real Bay Area locations into every plot. Candy was bright, tough, and fearless. She used her pistol infrequently, but was unintimidated by bad guys, regardless of circumstances. Threats, assaults, and even bullets would usually produce a caustic, but clever, response for this blonde sleuth. She and Mallard were frequently working the same case, but she usually solved it first. OTR experts generally agree that this show was the finest of all the female PIs. Although the show ran until May 1951, it never attracted a sponsor (although the first season's final episode ended with the announcement that \"Candy Matson Is San Francisco's Most Popular Program\"). <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

An audition show was done on August 23, 1950. Harold Peary was the creator and main performer for the show. Previously starring on <i>The Great Gildersleeve</i>, Peary took many of Gildy's characteristics along with him to his new Honest Harold character... the \"dirty\" laugh, singing songs, and closing dialogue over credits were all there with Harold. And that voice. Who could forget that voice? In simple terms, Peary couldn't or wouldn't sound and act differently enough to make listeners forget Gildy, and that made it very tough for the new show to fly. Perhaps the plot was a little creaky for the beginning of the Rock 'n' Roll era, as well. The show was about an older, unmarried guy, Honest Harold Hemp, who lived with his mother and nephew and did a radio homemaker's program. The townsfolk think of him as somewhat of a celebrity, but his girlfriend, Gloria, who works at the station, knows better. The series received undeserved negative ratings and general negative comments as there were just too many similarities between the two series. Also, the series was without a sponsor, although some of the last shows were sponsored by the US Armed Forces. The series lasted only one season. The regular cast consisted of Harold Peary, Gloria Holiday, Peary’s wife, who played Gloria, Joseph Kearns as Old Doc ‘Yak Yak’ Yancy, Mary Jane Croft and Parley Baer. The announcer was Bob Lamond. The series was directed by Norman MacDonnell. Writers for the series were Harold Peary, Bill Danch, Jack Robinson and Gene Stone. Music was by Jack Meakin. The last show aired on June 13, 1951. The director of the show was Norm MacDonnell, who went on to create perhaps the greatest old time radio show - <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Gunsmoke\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gunsmoke</a>, and another western, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Fort_Laramie\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fort Laramie</a>. Of course, Norm was a sold radio veteran who certainly had a flare for directing comedy, so he and Peary, together with an excellent cast, made The Harold Peary Show just about as good a show as it could be.</blockquote>",

The Delmore Brothers, together with other brother duets such as the Louvin Brothers, the Blue Sky Boys, the Monroe Brothers (Birch, Charlie and Bill Monroe), the McGee Brothers, and The Stanley Brothers, had a profound impact on the history of country music and American popular music. The brothers were born into poverty in Elkmont, Alabama, as the sons of tenant farmers amid a rich tradition of gospel music and Appalachian folk. Their mother, Mollie Delmore, wrote and sang gospel songs for their church. The Delmores blended gospel-style harmonies with the quicker guitarwork of traditional folk music and the blues to help create the still-emerging genre of country. In addition to the regular six-string acoustic guitar, the duo was one of the few to use the rare tenor guitar, a four-string instrument that had primarily been used previously in vaudeville shows. In 1925 Alton wrote his first song \"Bound For the Shore\" at the age of 13, (co-written with his mother).It was published by Athens Music Co. The Brother's did their first recording session for Columbia in 1931, recording \"I've Got the Kansas City Blues\" and \"Alabama Lullaby\", which became their theme song. They signed a contract with Victor Recordâs budget label Bluebird in 1933 and became regulars on the Grand Ole Opry variety program Within three years, they had become the most popular act on the show. Disagreements with Opry management led to the brothers leaving the show in 1939. While they continued to play and record music throughout the 1940s, they never achieved the same level of success they had with the Grand Ole Opry. In 1941, their song \"When It's Time For The Whippoorwill To Sing\" made the Billboard \"Hillbilly\" top three. Their best-known song, \"Blues Stay Away From Me,\" is regarded by some as the first rock and roll record. It was covered by Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps, The Louvin Brothers and The Everly Brothers. Rabon died of lung cancer in 1952. Following Rabon's death, Alton suffered a heart attack, the loss of his father and his daughter Susan, all within a three-year period. He moved back in Huntsville, Alabama. He taught some guitar, did odd jobs, and devoted his creative energies to writing prose. He wrote a series of short stories and his autobiography, Truth is Stranger than Publicity, published posthumously in the 1970s. Over the course of their careers, the Delmores wrote more than one thousand songs. Some of the most popular were Brownâs Ferry Blues, Gonna Lay Down My Old Guitar and Fifteen Miles from Birmingham. We apologize for the poor sound quality of these recordings, but they are the best mp3s available. <font size=\"-2\">Information from Wikipedia</font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Delmore Brothers <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>May 18, 2012 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

The Lennen and Mitchell ad agency wanted to produce a comedy series for Old Gold cigarettes, a brand of the Lorillard Tobacco Company. The show was patterned after the successful format used by the <i>Lux Radio Theatre</i> and Cecil B. DeMille. Preston Sturges, an up and coming director, was originally tapped to host the show, but was already committed elsewhere, and so suggested Harold Lloyd, a silent film star, with whom he had worked in the past. As this was his first radio program, Lloyd worked for many months to get over his fear of the microphone. Critics believed he was improving as the season progressed, and would have eventually mastered the art had the series lasted more than one season. Though the adapted scripts and the actors were top-notch, the show eventually suffered from its 30 minute format, as too much had to be cut from the original movie scripts. Lennen and Mitchell pulled the plug on the show on May 28, 1945 when they announced <i>Meet Me at Parky's</i> would air in its place. Currently, there are 30 of the 32 episodes still in circulation -- 29 come from the estate of Harold Lloyd, in the original un-cut version, and one from the Armed Forces Radio Service. <font size=\"-2\"></font> From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

Johnny was an accomplished 'padder' of his expense account. The name of the show derives from the fact that he closed each show by totaling his expense account, and signing it \"End of report... Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\". Terry Salomonson in his authoritative \"A Radio Broadcast Log of the Drama Program Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", notes that the original working title was \"Yours Truly, Lloyd London\". Salomonson writes \"Lloyd London was scratched out of the body of (the Dick Powell) audition script and Johnny Dollar was written in. Thus the show was re-titled on this script and the main character was renamed. Why this was done was unclear â possibly to prevent a legal run-in with Lloydâs of London Insurance Company.\" Although based in Hartford, Connecticut, the insurance capital of the world, freelancer Johnny Dollar managed to get around quite a bit â his adventures taking him all over the world. There were some unusual devices used in the show that help set it apart from other shows. There was no partner, assistant, or secretary for Johnny. The character closest to a continuing role was that of Pat McCracken of the Universal Adjustment Bureau, who assigned Johnny many of his cases. Another atypical aspect gave the show additional credibility â frequently, characters on the show would mention that they had heard about Johnnyâs cases on the radio. Johnny often used his time when filling out his expense accounts to give the audience background information or to express his thoughts about the current case. No fewer than eight actors played Johnny Dollar. Dick Powell, of <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Rogues_Gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogueâs Gallery</a> fame, cut the original audition tape, but chose to do <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Richard_Diamond_Private_Detective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Diamond, Private Detective</a> instead. Gerald Mohr, of <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i> fame, auditioned in 1955, prior to Bob Bailey getting the title role. Through the first three actors to play Johnny Dollar (Charles Russell, Edmond O'Brien, and John Lund), there was little to distinguish the series from many other radio detective series. Dollar was just another hard-boiled detective in a medium that was overloaded with the stereotype. Charles Russell, the first to play the role, would throw silver dollars to bellboys and waiters. Luckily, this trite gimmick did not survive long. On October 3, 1955, after a hiatus of over a year, the show came back with a vengeance. A new production team, including director/writer Jack Johnstone, a new star, Bob Bailey, from the radio series <i>Let George Do It</i>, and a new format would set the series apart from its competitors. Johnny's cases were now a continuing serial, five days a week, for fifteen minutes each evening. With 75 minutes of airtime, minus commercials and openings and closings, there was sufficient time to develop good storylines and interesting characters. During this time, <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> attracted some of the best writers in Hollywood, including Jack Johnstone, E. Jack Neuman (using the pen name John Dawson), Robert Ryf, and Les Crutchfield. Bob Bailey also wrote a script while he was playing Johnny Dollar. He used the pen name Robert Bainter (Bainter was his middle name) as the scriptwriter for \"The Carmen Kringle Matter\", which was aired on Saturday, December 21, 1957 on the West Coast, and on the following day for the rest of the country. Bob Bailey, generally thought of as the most popular of the Johnny Dollars, brought a new interpretation to the character â tough, but not hard-boiled; streetwise, but not overly cynical, Bailey's Dollar was smart and gritty when he had to be. But Bailey's Johnny Dollar was also human. His character would get emotionally involved in a number of his cases. He had a streak of impatience, and would occasionally not fully listen to a witness and rush off on a tangent before realizing his mistake. The weekday serialized episodes are generally acknowledged as some of the finest radio detective shows ever produced. There were fifty six multi-part shows in all: fifty four five-part shows, one six-part show, and one nine-part show. The serialized episodes continued until November 2, 1956 when the series again reverted to a once a week, thirty minute format. Bob Bailey continued in the lead, until \"The Empty Threat Matter\" of November 27, 1960, when the Hollywood run ended. The guest stars and supporting casts were always first rate, attracting the best radio actors in both Los Angeles and New York. Pat McCracken was played by several actors â most frequently, by Larry Dobkin. Particularly noteworthy was the work of Virginia Gregg, who played many roles, including Johnny's girlfriend Betty Lewis. Harry Bartell was also a frequent guest, who did many of the Spanish dialect roles when Johnny went to a Latin American country. Other frequent guest performers were Parley Baer, Tony Barrett, John Dehner, Don Diamond, Sam Edwards, Herb Ellis, Frank Gerstle, Stacy Harris, Jack Kruschen, Forrest Lewis, Howard McNear, Marvin Miller, Jeanette Nolan, Vic Perrin, Barney Phillips, Jean Tatum, Russell Thomson, Ben Wright, and Will Wright. Vincent Price co-starred as himself in \"The Price of Fame Matter\" and went to Europe with Johnny on the case. In December 1960, the show moved to New York. Robert Readick started the New York run as Dollar, but only lasted a short while. Jack Johnstone continued to write for the show and submitted scripts from California. Johnstone wrote about 350 Johnny Dollar scripts under his own name and his pen names Sam Dawson and Jonathan Bundy. Johnstone wrote the last episodes of both <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> and <i>Suspense</i>. He used the Bundy pen name when writing the last <i>Suspense</i> episode, \"Devilstone\". And so, an era passed. <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> was the last continuing detective series of the Golden Age of Radio. Mandel Kramer was the last Johnny Dollar, and a close second in popularity to Bailey, when the final episode, \"The Tip-Off Matter\", was aired on September 30, 1962. <font size=\"1\">Material for this description was prepared by Stewart Wright.</font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

We believe that Maurice Francis, an enthusiastic writer, and Nell Sterling, two of George Edwards long-time collaborators, were also featured in 'Afloat With Henry Morgan'. To save money, Edwards played a variety of different roles and became known as 'the Man With A Thousand Voices'.

Groucho Marx Biography Born: October 2, 1890 in New York City, New York Died: August 19, 1977 in Los Angeles, California Groucho was born Julius Henry Marx on October 2, 1890 in New York. He was the third of the five surviving sons of Sam and Minnie Marx. He was the first of the brothers to start stage career aged 15 in an act called <i>The Leroy Trio</i>. Other acts followed, but none of them was a great success. Twice the other members of the act disappeared overnight and left him penniless in a town far away from home. When his brothers came on stage, they finally had a success with the musical comedy called <i>I'll Say She Is</i>. It was at one of the performances of this show that Groucho got his painted moustache. He arrived late at the theater and used greasepaint to create a moustache. He found this so much easier than a glued on moustache that he insisted on using this technique from then on. <i>I'll Say She Is</i> was followed by two more Broadway hits -- <i>The Cocoanuts</i> and <i>Animal Crackers</i>. The latter of which has the character of Captain Spaulding which remained (with the song Hooray for Captain Spaulding) a trademark for Groucho for the rest of his life. The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers were also the first movies (except for one unreleased on) made by the Brothers and were filmed in New York. The remaining movies were made in Hollywood. In the later years of the Marx Brothers movie career, Groucho started working on radio. He hosted several programs and was a guest on many shows. His biggest success was the comedy quiz show <i>You Bet Your Life</i> which started in 1947. The show later moved to television and was on the air until 1961. Groucho also appeared in a few movies without his brothers. Always being a liberal, Groucho sometimes made critical remarks about politics and had friends which were regarded as communist by the US of the 1950s. This let to Groucho being investigated by the FBI. When Marx Brothers became popular again in the last sixties/early seventies Groucho made a comeback with a show in Carnegie Hall in 1972. At the film festival in Cannes in 1972, he was made Commandeur des Arts et Lettres and in 1974 he received a special Academy Award for the achievements of the Marx Brothers. Groucho died on August 19th, 1977 at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. His ashes are at Eden Memorial Park, San Fernando, California. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>An Evening with Groucho <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>April 11, 2005 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

He cast his wife, Natalie Parks, in the title role of this sassy, sexy PI. Her understated love interest, Lt. Ray Mallard, was played by Henry Leff while her assistant and best pal, aptly named Rembrandt Watson, was the voice of Jack Thomas. Every show opened with a ringing telephone and our lady PI answering it with \"Candy Matson, YU 2-8209\" and then the organ swung into the theme song, \"Candy\". Each job took Candy from her apartment on Telegraph Hill into some actual location in San Francisco. The writers, overseen by Monty, worked plenty of real Bay Area locations into every plot. Candy was bright, tough, and fearless. She used her pistol infrequently, but was unintimidated by bad guys, regardless of circumstances. Threats, assaults, and even bullets would usually produce a caustic, but clever, response for this blonde sleuth. She and Mallard were frequently working the same case, but she usually solved it first. OTR experts generally agree that this show was the finest of all the female PIs. Although the show ran until May 1951, it never attracted a sponsor (although the first season's final episode ended with the announcement that \"Candy Matson Is San Francisco's Most Popular Program\"). <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

Their pursuit of wrong-doers led them to ex-Nazi jewel robbers in Berlin and Monte Carlo, import thieves in Tunis, etc. Most of his assignments came from international insurance companies thus making the program something of a cross between more familiar contemporaries <i>Dangerous Assignment</i> and <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i>. <font size=\"-2\">Sources: Thrillingdetective.com; On the Air, John Dunning; The 3rd Revised Ultimate History..., Jay Hickerson; Audio Classics.com (Salomonson)</font> <i>NOTE: \"TAOT\" in the names of the files is an abbreviation for \"The Adventure of The\".</i> NOTE: Updated Release!

This series didn't last long and starred Santos Ortega as Wolfe and Luis Van Rooten as Archie. The second series was during 1945 on the Mutual network in <i>The Amazing Nero Wolfe</i>. This lasted only until December 15, 1946 and starred Francis X. Bushman and Elliot Lewis as Archie. The third series was known as <i>The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe</i>. Starting on October 20, 1950 it lasted only until April 27, 1951. It starred Sidney Greenstreet as Nero Wolfe. The part of Archie was played by Lawrence Dobkin for the first twelve shows. Gerald Mohr took over for the next four shows after making a guest appearance in the twelfth show. Harry Bartell was Archie for the remainder of the series. Nero Wolfe, also known as the galloping gourmet, was an armchair detective. He rarely left the house; instead his assistant, Archie Goodwin, would collect the facts and report back. Nero Wolfe would probably not have taken on many cases had he not needed the clients' money to pay for his two true passions: fine food and the collecting of orchids. Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's male secretary, prodded him into taking cases whenever the bank balance got a little low. Wolfe, as a character, is difficult to like. He's a self-assured type that does nothing unless he wants to, making his assistant, Archie Goodwin, deal with the outside world. <i>The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe</i> is based on a series of books begun in 1934 by Rex Stout. There were two previous incarnations of the radio series: <i>The Adventures of Nero Wolfe</i> which ran in 1943 and 1944 and <i>The New Adventures of (aka The Amazing) Nero Wolfe</i> which ran in 1945 to 1946. Very few episodes from these earlier series are in circulation today. There was also one later series created by the Canadian Broadcasting Company in 1982. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

Van Dine first published in the mid 1920s. Vance, in the original books, is an intellectual so highly refined he seems he might be ghostwritten by P. G. Wodehouse. Take this quote from <i>The Benson Murder Case</i>, 1924, as Vance pontificates in his inimitable way: \"That's your fundamental error, don't y' know. Every crime is witnessed by outsiders, just as is every work of art. The fact that no one sees the criminal, or the artist, actu'lly at work, is wholly incons'quential.\" Thankfully, the radio series uses only the name, and makes Philo a pretty normal, though very intelligent and extremely courteous gumshoe. Jose Ferrer played him in 1945. From 1948-1950, the fine radio actor Jackson Beck makes Vance as good as he gets. George Petrie plays Vance's constantly impressed public servant, District Attorney Markham. Joan Alexander is Ellen Deering, Vance's secretary and right-hand woman. The organist for the show is really working those ivories, and fans of old time radio organ will especially enjoy this series. Perhaps one reason the organist \"pulls out all the stops\" is because there seems to be little, if any, sound effects on the show. <i>Philo Vance</i>, the radio series, does pay homage to the original books in that both were, even in their own time, a bit out of date and stilted.

O</font></b></u></i></p> A transcribed syndication of original broadcasts from <i>Lights Out</i>. With its premiere on the nationwide NBC hookup in 1935, <i>Lights Out</i> was billed \"the ultimate in horror.\" Never had such sounds been heard on the air. Heads rolled, bones were crushed, people fell from great heights and splattered wetly on pavement. There were garrotings, choking, heads split by cleavers, and, to a critic at Radio Guide, \"the most monstrous of all sounds, human flesh being eaten.\" Few shows had ever combined the talents of actors and imaginative writers so well with the graphic art of the sound technician. Wyllis Cooper, who created, wrote, and produced it, was then a 36-year-old staffer in Chicago's NBC Studios. Cooper created his horror \"by raiding the larder.\" For the purposed of <i>Lights Out</i> sound effects, people were what they ate. The sound of a butcher knife rending a piece of uncooked pork was, when accompanied by shrieks and screams, the essence of murder to a listener alone at midnight. Real bones were broken - spareribs snapped with a pipe wrench. Bacon in a frypan gave a vivid impression of a body just electrocuted. And the cannibalism effect was actually a zealous actor. Gurgling and smacking his lips as he slurped up a bowl of spaghetti. Cabbages sounded like human heads when chopped open with a cleaver, and carrots had the pleasant resonance of fingers being lopped off. Arch Oboler's celebrated tale of a man turned inside-out by a demonic fog was accomplished by soaking a rubber glove in water and stripping it off at the microphone while a berry basket was curshed at the same instant. The listener saw none of this. The listener saw carnage and death. Cooper left the show in 1936 and Oboler was given the job. Oboler lost no time establishing himself as the new master of the macabre. Between May 1936 and July 1938, he wrote and directed more than 100 <i>Lights Out</i> plays. To follow Cooper was a challenge: he was \"the unsung pioneer of radio dramatic techniques,\" but Oboler had passed the test with his first play. His own name soon became synonymous with murder and gore, though horror as a genre had always left him cold. Oboler aspired to more serious writing. Oboler's shows are well represented -- this series of <i>Lights Out</i> was syndicated in <i>The Devil and Mr. O</i> offerings of 1970 - 73.

In it, Frank played Rocky Fortune, a \"footloose and fancy-free young man,\" frequently unemployed, who took numerous, adventurous odd jobs. It was a relatively undistinguished series; definitely a \"B grade\" radio series, saved by Sinatra's charm and a tongue-in-cheek approach. <i>Rocky Fortune</i> appeared on NBC for only a short run of 25 or 26 shows. The lead character, who goes by the name of Rocky Fortune but whose real name is Rocko Fortunato, was played by Frank Sinatra. Rocky, always ready with a wise remark, seems to be a magnet for trouble, most often with the variety of odd jobs he takes. There is frequently a beautiful woman involved, some good girls, some bad. Rocky's a tough guy who stays just inside of the law but we get an occasional glimpse of a soft heart beneath the hard exterior. It's a character that Mr. Sinatra plays nicely. Employed or not, Rocky possesed a variety of skills. During the course of the series, he worked as a process server, museum tour guide, cabbie, bodyguard, chauffeur, truck driver, social director for a Catskills resort and a carny. He could also fake enough bass to play at weddings and bar-mitzvahs. For most of the series, Rocky received his job assignments from the Gridley Employment Agency, usually referred to as just \"the agency\". The only recurring character, throughout the series, besides Rocky himself, is the long-suffering Sergeant Hamilton J. Finger - a solid, although not-too-bright cop who works out of what is frequently referred to as \"the Irish clubhouse,\" who seemed to be constantly running into Rocky, whether he wanted to or not. At about the same time, November 10, 1953 to July 9, 1954, Sinatra also starred in a musical show on NBC called <i>To Be Perfectly Frank</i>. And, no matter how you look at it, <i>Rocky Fortune</i> was really just another chance for the ever-ambitious Sinatra to be himself, and to promote his career. \"From Here To Eternity\" had opened that August, and Sinatra used the series to promote the film (and his Oscar nomination). As the series wound to a close and the date of the Academy Awards presentation drew near, it became a running gag that Rocky seemed to work the phrase \"from here to eternity\" into almost every show. Fortunately for his career, his Oscar for his role in Eternity came and rescued him from all this. Most scripts were written by Ernest Kinoy and George Lefferts, who also wrote <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Dimension_X\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dimension X</a> and <i>X Minus One</i> scripts. (Frequently, the same music bridges can be heard for <i>X Minus One</i> in early espisodes of this series.) Fred Weihe and Andrew Love directed.

Some sources even mention that the program was developed around Jolson and his talents. However, Jolson left the series briefly in the fall of 1935 due to a movie commitment. Wallace Beery, one of the country’s most popular film stars of the period took over the host position following a one week stint by radio newsman, Walter Winchell. Jolson returned in January of 1936, but didn’t hang around for long and departed permanently in April 1936. Based on a recommendation by the program’s music director, Victor Young, Smith Ballew was installed as the new host and remained with the program for the remainder of 1936. Smith Ballew had previously worked extensively on records with Victor Young; they had been friends since 1926. The <i>Shell Chateau</i> program appears to be one of Ballew’s last gig’s as a big band musican and he started carving out a name for himself as an actor, when Sol Lesser invited Ballew to do a series of 'B' Westerns for Twentieth Century Fox as a singing cowboy. In 1937, the program was reorganized around the Legendary Broadway comic Joe Cook. The essential format remained the same until the series ended in June 1937. It’s unfortunate that this certified series is missing the episodes featuring Walter Winchell and Joe Cook, perhaps one day representative episodes will became available. And now a few brief comments about the series and Al Jolson: Al Jolson was known in the industry as \"The World's Greatest Entertainer,\" for well over 40 years. During that time such performers as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, and many others spoke of Jolson in this way. After his death his influence continued unabated with such performers as Elvis Presley, Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Jackie Wilson and Jerry Lee Lewis, all mentioning Jolson as an inspiration. Jolson on radio faired better, at the time of the <i>Shell Chateau</i> broadcasts, than in the movies. Though Jolson ushered in the sound era in movies with the landmark 1926 film, “Jazz Singer” for Warner Brothers. Critics generally viewed his screen appearances as a pale ghost of the stage Jolson. On film, with a few exceptions, Jolson come across as stiff and wooden. He continued into the 1930s making but was most popular on radio. This situation continued until the mid 40s when Columbia Pictures, inspired by the success of its film \"Yankee Doodle Dandy,\" decided a Jolson biography might work as well. So in 1946 Columbia rolled out TheJolson Story, starring Larry Parks miming to Jolson's vocals. It was the surprise smash hit of the season, and the highest grossing film of the year. Parks received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor. Because of the film, Jolson was now as big, or bigger, than ever. Al Jolson had a life-long devotion to entertaining American troops, servicemen and women, and against the advice of his doctors, agreed to entertain the troops in Korea in 1950 it was during this overseas tour that his heart began to fail. He died on October 23, 1950, in San Francisco, California at the age of 64, evidently of a heart attack, and was interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. On the day he died, the bright lights of Broadway were turned off for 10 minutes in his honor. From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

His quest to bring the killer to justice serves as the springboard to an unexpected new career as a crimefighting attorney struggling to bring order to his small corner of the frontier as it makes the difficult transition from the Old West to the New. Remington is played initially by Jeff Chandler, oddly billed here as \"Tex\" Chandler despite being at this time already an established star in both radio (<i>Our Miss Brooks</i>) and film (<i>Broken Arrow</i>). Halfway through the program's relatively short run, the role is assumed by another veteran actor, Reed Hadley. The obligatory Western sidekick is a hard-drinking gentleman of mixed blood called Cherokee O'Bannon, and is played by comedic character actor Wade Crosby, who chose to borrow W.C.

In the early 1930s Smilin' Ed McConnell promoted Aladdin Kerosene Lamps with remarkable success over WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio. He became a well known radio personality as 'The Aladdin Lamp Man' who sang songs, told stories and sold Aladdin lamps over the air. By 1948, 145 ABC stations were subscribing to his 15 minute programs. Smilin' Ed's humor, songs, and music were condensed into a five-minute program especially for electric lamp dealers. So it is very likely that this series originated after 1948. Through his personable style, Smilin' Ed touched the lives of millions of housewives. He said in one program, 'Honey, a house without an Aladdin kerosene or electric lamp is like a house without a door -- incomplete!' From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

The radio program broadcasts adaptations of films with the original directors of the films sometimes involved in the production although their participation was usually limited to introducing the radio program and taking a brief curtain call with the cast and host at the end of the show. During the 19505 to 1956 season the series was seen on television. There it focused on original teleplays and also several adaptations of famous short stories like Robert Louis Stevenson’s <i>Markheim</i>. The radio version ran for 122 episodes and aired on NBC from January 9, 1949 to September 28, 1951 under several different titles.

Although hewing to a strict story line, the show neverless also was able to supply considerable descriptive color to the manner of life in those days. For example, the listerner may learn of the customs by which the master of the house is waited upon by his wife at all meals and that she and the rest of the family may not partake until the head of the rancho has finished. The commercials, too, proceeded along similar lines, recollecting that in the period being dramatized there were but a few parcels of land and those were of tremendous size, owned by wealthy individuals. Now there are over 2,000,000 seperate parcels of land in Los Angeles County alone. The program was well written and the historical material adds nicely to the flavor.

Titled <i>The Grantland Rice Story</i>, the 15-minute series comprised fifty-two sequential installments. First airing regionally as early as August 1955, the entire run soon appeared across the nation on various stations at varying times. Some aired it every weekday, some three days a week, some weekly. The program's 15-minute installments closely followed the text of Rice's book. Jimmy Powers, himself a noted sportswriter and announcer of 30 years, narrated, read and commented on Grantland Rice's story in the first person, as Rice had intended. Not quite the equivalent of today's audio-books, the material from \"The Tumult and The Shouting\" was augmented by contemporary asides and updates from Jimmy Powers. The series literally begins at chapter one of Rice's book and moves through the entire autobiography. Powers intersperses the selections from the book with other timely updates and observations about Rice not contained in the book. The additional material helps expand the legend of Rice himself, places his work in context with the era, and provides insights not previously available when the book was written some 11 years earlier. The entire syndicated series apparently aired in several overlapping markets. Tracking the broadcasts was particularly difficult given the 15 minute format. As best as we can establish, there was at least one contiguous run of the entire 52-installment series airing between September 1955 and September 1956. The series also aired in many markets at the 15-minute mark, often 'buried' behind an on-the-hour broadcast of another program. The series provides the most comprehensive insight into the career and experiences of one of the most important sportswriters in American history, during an era when the pen and typewriter was still as important to news media as the paper it was printed upon.

Between March 18 and September 9, 1945, the melodramatic anthology series was broadcast on Sundays from 10:30pm to 11:00pm. Each week, after \"the sound of the great gong,\" host Philip Clarke observed that the mysteriously silent \"keeper of the book has opened the ponderous door to the secret vault wherein is kept the great sealed book, in which is recorded all the secrets and mysteries of mankind through the ages, Here are tales of every kind, tales of murder, of madness, of dark deeds strange and terrible beyond all belief.\" After this introduction, the dramas began, occasionally interrupted by curiously extended organ solos. Although this anthology series did not have recurring characters (other than the Narrator and the Keeper of the Book), the writers often used the same names for different characters from week to week, including \"Hester,\" \"Drake,\" and most especially \"Roger.\" At the end of an episode, Clarke told listeners to tune in the following week when \"the sound of the great gong heralds another strange and exciting tale from... the sealed book.\" Scripts were by Robert Arthur, Jr. and David Kogan, who also were responsible for The Mysterious Traveler, and recycled many of the more popular stories from that parent program. \"The Hands of Death\" was the first of the 26 episodes which concluded with \"Death Laughs Last.\" <font size=\"-2\">Information from WikiPedia</font> </blockquote>",

Johnny was an accomplished 'padder' of his expense account. The name of the show derives from the fact that he closed each show by totaling his expense account, and signing it \"End of report... Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\". Terry Salomonson in his authoritative \"A Radio Broadcast Log of the Drama Program Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", notes that the original working title was \"Yours Truly, Lloyd London\". Salomonson writes \"Lloyd London was scratched out of the body of (the Dick Powell) audition script and Johnny Dollar was written in. Thus the show was re-titled on this script and the main character was renamed. Why this was done was unclear â possibly to prevent a legal run-in with Lloydâs of London Insurance Company.\" Although based in Hartford, Connecticut, the insurance capital of the world, freelancer Johnny Dollar managed to get around quite a bit â his adventures taking him all over the world. There were some unusual devices used in the show that help set it apart from other shows. There was no partner, assistant, or secretary for Johnny. The character closest to a continuing role was that of Pat McCracken of the Universal Adjustment Bureau, who assigned Johnny many of his cases. Another atypical aspect gave the show additional credibility â frequently, characters on the show would mention that they had heard about Johnnyâs cases on the radio. Johnny often used his time when filling out his expense accounts to give the audience background information or to express his thoughts about the current case. No fewer than eight actors played Johnny Dollar. Dick Powell, of <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Rogues_Gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogueâs Gallery</a> fame, cut the original audition tape, but chose to do <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Richard_Diamond_Private_Detective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Diamond, Private Detective</a> instead. Gerald Mohr, of <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i> fame, auditioned in 1955, prior to Bob Bailey getting the title role. Through the first three actors to play Johnny Dollar (Charles Russell, Edmond O'Brien, and John Lund), there was little to distinguish the series from many other radio detective series. Dollar was just another hard-boiled detective in a medium that was overloaded with the stereotype. Charles Russell, the first to play the role, would throw silver dollars to bellboys and waiters. Luckily, this trite gimmick did not survive long. On October 3, 1955, after a hiatus of over a year, the show came back with a vengeance. A new production team, including director/writer Jack Johnstone, a new star, Bob Bailey, from the radio series <i>Let George Do It</i>, and a new format would set the series apart from its competitors. Johnny's cases were now a continuing serial, five days a week, for fifteen minutes each evening. With 75 minutes of airtime, minus commercials and openings and closings, there was sufficient time to develop good storylines and interesting characters. During this time, <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> attracted some of the best writers in Hollywood, including Jack Johnstone, E. Jack Neuman (using the pen name John Dawson), Robert Ryf, and Les Crutchfield. Bob Bailey also wrote a script while he was playing Johnny Dollar. He used the pen name Robert Bainter (Bainter was his middle name) as the scriptwriter for \"The Carmen Kringle Matter\", which was aired on Saturday, December 21, 1957 on the West Coast, and on the following day for the rest of the country. Bob Bailey, generally thought of as the most popular of the Johnny Dollars, brought a new interpretation to the character â tough, but not hard-boiled; streetwise, but not overly cynical, Bailey's Dollar was smart and gritty when he had to be. But Bailey's Johnny Dollar was also human. His character would get emotionally involved in a number of his cases. He had a streak of impatience, and would occasionally not fully listen to a witness and rush off on a tangent before realizing his mistake. The weekday serialized episodes are generally acknowledged as some of the finest radio detective shows ever produced. There were fifty six multi-part shows in all: fifty four five-part shows, one six-part show, and one nine-part show. The serialized episodes continued until November 2, 1956 when the series again reverted to a once a week, thirty minute format. Bob Bailey continued in the lead, until \"The Empty Threat Matter\" of November 27, 1960, when the Hollywood run ended. The guest stars and supporting casts were always first rate, attracting the best radio actors in both Los Angeles and New York. Pat McCracken was played by several actors â most frequently, by Larry Dobkin. Particularly noteworthy was the work of Virginia Gregg, who played many roles, including Johnny's girlfriend Betty Lewis. Harry Bartell was also a frequent guest, who did many of the Spanish dialect roles when Johnny went to a Latin American country. Other frequent guest performers were Parley Baer, Tony Barrett, John Dehner, Don Diamond, Sam Edwards, Herb Ellis, Frank Gerstle, Stacy Harris, Jack Kruschen, Forrest Lewis, Howard McNear, Marvin Miller, Jeanette Nolan, Vic Perrin, Barney Phillips, Jean Tatum, Russell Thomson, Ben Wright, and Will Wright. Vincent Price co-starred as himself in \"The Price of Fame Matter\" and went to Europe with Johnny on the case. In December 1960, the show moved to New York. Robert Readick started the New York run as Dollar, but only lasted a short while. Jack Johnstone continued to write for the show and submitted scripts from California. Johnstone wrote about 350 Johnny Dollar scripts under his own name and his pen names Sam Dawson and Jonathan Bundy. Johnstone wrote the last episodes of both <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> and <i>Suspense</i>. He used the Bundy pen name when writing the last <i>Suspense</i> episode, \"Devilstone\". And so, an era passed. <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> was the last continuing detective series of the Golden Age of Radio. Mandel Kramer was the last Johnny Dollar, and a close second in popularity to Bailey, when the final episode, \"The Tip-Off Matter\", was aired on September 30, 1962. <font size=\"1\">Material for this description was prepared by Stewart Wright.</font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Indeed, production would halt if necessary on a film if performers were called to appear on Lux. When the actors were not available, others stepped in.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">MOLLE MYSTERY THEATER</font></b></u></i></p> NBC's <i>Mystery Theatre</i> began airing with much fanfare on September 7, 1943. The series promised stories from the greatest classical and contemporary mystery authors -- and production values to match. And it kept its promise. It was aided from the outset by the addition of an 'annotator'-- as it was described in the 1940s --named Geoffrey Barnes. The annotator served in the role of expositor, filling in on the plot development as necessary and providing a back-story when needed. The apparent distinction made between a narrator and an annotator, was a matter of degree. Mr. Barnes, a distinguished and celebrated amateur criminologist in his own right, was apparently on hand to help the listener analyze and understand the various mysteries and their underlying crimes within each script. The program appears to have aired sustained for its first three months, with three to five sponsors beginning to make an appearance with Program #17, \"The Mystery of The Seven Keys\" of December 28, 1943. There is a circulating program titled \"Homicide for Hannah\", that should have been the first <i>Molle Mystery Theatre</i>, but there is no provenance anywhere that the initial program ever actually aired. This is the first circulating program in which we hear the program refer to itself as <i>Molle Mystery Theatre</i>. But throughout its NBC run, we hear sponsorship by Ironized Yeast, Energene, Bayer Aspirin, Sterling Drug, and Molle. To its everlasting credit, NBC clearly went to great lengths to promote the script titles, performers and authors of each program to the nation's newpapers. From 1943 through 1948, <i>Mystery Theatre</i> was one of the most well documented and promoted radio programs of its time. Indeed, so many details were available for its entire NBC run that this was one of the easiest logs we've developed in some time. We have solid, highly detailed newspaper listing provenances for almost ninety percent of the first 237 programs. Sadly, the transition from NBC to CBS didn't fare as well for <i>Mystery Theatre</i>. NBC and CBS were waging a major war at the time, each network nakedly poaching the other's greatest Radio talent and programs, wholesale. But judging from the way NBC and CBS -- and Frank and Anne Hummert -- promoted and supported their respective line-ups, it's clear that CBS was dropping the ball for the greater part of 1949. Frank and Anne Hummert were legendary talents in the area of producing and promoting melodrama. Indeed, an extraordinary number of the serial melodramas of the era were produced and developed by The Hummerts. But <i>Mystery Theatre</i> wasn't a melodrama genre -- or format. That didn't stop the Hummerts from turning it into a melodrama under their watch. The franchise declined in popular and critical favor from that point forward. In all, <i>Mystery Theatre</i> in its various incarnations ran almost continuously from the Fall line-up of 1943 well into 1952 -- an impressive nine year run in its various guises. It ran four years over NBC, three years over CBS and two years over ABC. For NBC the program aired as either <i>Mystery Theatre</i> or <i>Molle Mystery Theatre</i>. Over CBS, the program aired as <i>[Frank and Anne Hummert's] Mystery Theatre</i> and <i>Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i>. And finally, over ABC, the program aired as <i>Inspector Mark Saber of The Homicide Squad</i> or <i>Mark Saber Mysteries</i>. CBS and the Hummerts began rolling out spot ads and teaser articles about the Inspector Hearthstone programs in the Fall of 1949 but by the end of the 1951 run of Mystery Theatre the spot ads dwindled. Despite the more lackluster, melodramatic scripts, the Hummerts, relying on Alfred Shirley's celebrity and reputation, actively promoted the Inspector Hearthstone programming with their usual relentless and efficient skill--when it suited them. Apparently the reviewers of the era weren't very impressed by The Hummerts' scripts or cast. <i>Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i> held some promise to breathe new life into the franchise with distinguished actor Alfred Shirley (of Sherlock Holmes fame) in the role of Inspector Hearthstone. Inspector Hearthstone was first introduced in February and March episodes of CBS's 1949 <i>Mystery Theatre</i> run. From 1949 to the Fall of 1951, Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad appeared in all but a few of the remaining <i>Mystery Theatre</i> programs, until CBS simply changed the production name to <i>Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i> on August 30, 1951. One can only surmise CBS' rationale for preserving the name <i>Mystery Theatre</i> while producing only Inspector Hearthstone programs for almost two years. It would seem as if Frank Hummert was more comfortable working with a single protagonist for his programs, hence his almost universal focus on Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad as the central figure in almost all of the CBS <i>Mystery Theatre</i> programs from 1948-1951. One of CBS <i>Mystery Theatre's</i> most redeeming elements -- annotator Geoffrey Barnes -- was eliminated with the solo Hearthstone of The Death Squad that followed. The Hummerts chose, instead, to go with a melodramatic intro to each program more reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Challenge_of_the_Yukon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Challenge of the Yukon</a> or <i>The Lone Ranger</i>, than the CBS <i>Mystery Theatre</i> format of the previous two years. Indeed, by 1952, <i>Hearthstone of the Death Squad</i> was being heard virtually every day of the week -- somewhere, usually in repeats. CBS had apparently abandoned any further promotion of the series. Throughout most of 1952, Hearthstone of the Death Squad was in total disarray. As it was, <i>Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i> finally left the airwaves December 31, 1952 -- for the most part in repeats in various small outlets and at varying days and times. By the beginning of <i>Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i> in 1951, Television had already taken root. To further complicate the Radio and Television choices, a competing Mystery Theater from ABC aired on October 3, 1951 running in parallel with both CBS <i>Mystery Theatre's Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i> and <i>ABC's Mystery Theater</i> featuring Inspector Mark Saber of the Homicide Squad. If the intent was to confuse, both programs succeeded, and both came in for tepid reviews -- at best. In addition there were parallel Television programs titled both <i>Mystery Theater</i> and <i>Homicide Squad</i>. It's apparent that Radio and Television programmers had finally taken off the gloves in earnest. In the final analysis, the <i>Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i> run from 1951-1952 appears to have been nothing more than thriteen or so original Hearthstone programs intermixed with a year's worth of repeats of CBS <i>Mystery Theatre</i> programs. There is no direct connection whatsoever between the lineage of the various NBC and CBS <i>Mystery Theatre</i> incarnations of <i>Mystery Theatre</i> and ABC's completely different and separate <i>Mystery Theater</i>; the network, sponsor, cast, technicians and recurring characters were all completely different. However, it may be useful to describe the essential details of ABC's <i>Mystery Theater</i> to dispel any lingering ambiguities as to its lineage. ABC <i>Mystery Theater</i> [not Theatre] ran from October 3, 1951 to July 1, 1953. It's initial run of 37 episodes starred Robert Carroll as Inspector Mark Saber. It broke for the Summer of 1953 on June 11, then resumed on October 8, 1952 with a different cast. Veteran Radio actor Les Damon became Inspector Mark Saber and Walter Burke became Saber's right hand, Sergeant Tim Maloney. Clearly positioning itself in direct competition with CBS' <i>Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i>, ABC's rendition of the genre was more grounded in American big city homicide. Its production values were somewhat better than the deteriorating scripts and engineering of <i>Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i>, but both series were somewhat lackluster compared to their Television competition. And neither series ever captured the superb writing, voice talent, engineering and production values of NBC's <i>Mystery Theatre</i> series. <font size=\"-2\">From <a href=\"http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Molle-Mystery-Theatre.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Digital Deli Too</a>.</font> From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

The show moved to Hollywood on May 25, 1936 with the production of <i>The Legionnaire and the Lady</i>, based on the film <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco_%28film%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morocco</a></i>, starring <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlene_Dietrich\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marlene Dietrich</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clark Gable</a>.

For its last season, (1954-1955), the show moved to Tuesday nights at 9 on NBC.<br /><br /><i>Lux Radio Theatre</i> was always broadcast live, with a studio audience and a full orchestra accompanying the performance and providing musical transitions between scenes. As many film actors were used to numerous takes and not live performance, they sometimes suffered acute stage fright before the show. However, since most received $5,000 for their performance – in addition to free publicity for upcoming pictures – actors appeared in their original screen roles if they were available. Indeed, production would halt if necessary on a film if performers were called to appear on Lux. When the actors were not available, others stepped in. The plays were assembled and rehearsed for a week, in sharp contrast to many other shows, which required a minimal of an actor’s time. Regular players for the series included Jim and Marian Jordan, otherwise known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fibber McGee and Molly</a>.

It had a short run through the Summer on Sundays, changing to Fridays after its Summer run. The last show aired Oct. 22, 1950. The series told fictional stories of OSS agents during World War II who took dangerous missions behind enemy lines, knowing they may never return alive. The series was based on the 1946 book \"Cloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of the OSS\". It was a tense half hour of patriots and traitors, of triumph, tragedy and failure. The stories did not always end in success -- sometimes, the hero/agent gave up his life. There were 22 episodes, broadcast in 1950. The theme music was either identical or very similar to that used by <i>Tales of the Texas Rangers</i>. Sherman Marks directed. The cast consisted of The Hungarian Giant, played by Raymond Edward Johnson, and Impy, the Midget, played by Gilbert Mack. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Cloak and Dagger <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>September 6, 2009 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 2 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">POLICE REPORTER</font></b></u></i></p> Based on true crime stories, \"The Police Reporter\" was a fifteen minute dramatic series syndicated by Radio Release Limited. The earliest listing found for it was in the December 10, 1933 issue of the \"New York Times\" where it showed up on WEAF's program grid on Friday, December 15, 1933 at 10:00 pm. There are also several listings in the \"Los Angeles Times\" in February and March 1936 for a fifteen minute \"Police Reporter\" program on KGPJ at 8:00 pm. The company that produced the series, Radio Release Limited is listed in the 1934 edition of \"The Writer's Market\", noting that they're \"looking for anything with commercial value and will consider good scripts carefully. Pays good rates\". The company is also listed in the 1935 edition of \"Broadcasting: Yearbook-Marketbook Issue\" on page 122. \"The Police Reporter\" is a quarter hour drama that might remind you a bit of \"Front Page Drama\" in its sensationalism and melodrama. What makes the series unique is that all the stories featured are true. \"Gangbusters\", the pioneering \"true crime\" series of the period, premiered in July 1935 on NBC as \"G-Men\" according to Wikipedia. So, \"The Police Reporter\" pre-dates the more famous network show by a couple of years - if not the first, it could be one of the earliest true crime shows on the air. Program 1 of the series is about a man who has been missing for four days. A neighbor calls the police, thinking something may be wrong. It's the Lincoln murder case, which occurred in Aurora, Illinois in 1923. The program includes an announcement that this is the first program of the series. The series uses real names, dates and locations, so it's easy to track down information on the real cases dramatized on many of the programs. There was a detailed May 13, 2007 newspaper article from the Aurora Beacon News about the murder. There are 26 shows in the distribution and they are digitized directly from a set of original transcription discs.</blockquote>",

Keen (he never had a first name, unless it was “Peachy”) was assisted in these duties by an Irishman named Mike Clancy. Mike wasn’t much of a brainiac (the quote that comprises the title of this post was a semi-catchphrase that he seemed to use on the show every week) but he could use the necessary brawn when the situation called for it. <a href=\"http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?ID=48062\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bennett Kilpack</a> played kindly ol' Keen throughout most of the program’s run, as well as Philip Clarke and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Hughes_%28actor%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arthur Hughes, </a>while Jim Kelly took the role of Clancy. The series originally aired as a thrice-weekly fifteen-minute serial from 1937-43 (the show moved to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS\" rel=\"nofollow\">CBS</a> in 1942), providing more than ample time for Keen to solve even the most baffling of disappearances. Beginning November 11, 1943, the program changed its format to that of a half-hour weekly offering—and though the title and theme song remained, Keen branched out into investigating murders. If <i>Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons</i> sounds a little soap opera-ish, it’s because it originated from the “radio fiction factory” of Frank and Anne Hummert. (Frank received on-air credit for the writing, but the scripts were actually churned out by scribes like Lawrence Klee, Bob Shaw, Barbara Bates and Stedman Coles.) Mr. Keen“ employed all the stereotypes, heavy dialogue, and trite plotting of its daytime cousins” and “it appealed to a lowest common denominator.” So why is the show so popular with old-time radio fans today? Simple…it’s pretty doggone funny, in an unintentional sort of way. <i>Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons</i> enjoyed a healthy eighteen-year stint over radio, ending its run not—as previously reported on this blog—on April 19, 1955 but on September 26 of that same year. Over the years, the series had a variety of sponsors: Bisodol, Kolynos toothpaste, Chesterfield cigarettes, American Chicle, etc., and there are nearly sixty broadcasts extant today for modern-day listeners to revel in. It’s ample evidence that not every show during the Golden Age of Radio was “golden”—but I gotta admit, it sure is fun. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>May 9, 2010 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 4.1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

As many film actors were used to numerous takes and not live performance, they sometimes suffered acute stage fright before the show. However, since most received $5,000 for their performance â in addition to free publicity for upcoming pictures â actors appeared in their original screen roles if they were available. Indeed, production would halt if necessary on a film if performers were called to appear on Lux. When the actors were not available, others stepped in. The plays were assembled and rehearsed for a week, in sharp contrast to many other shows, which required a minimal of an actorâs time.

To get ideas for his novels he placed an advertisement in a newspaper saying \"Adventure wanted, will go anywhere, do anything, Box 13.\" The ads always brought fun adventures of all kinds: from racketeer's victim to psychotic killer looking for fun. Most of the episodes were based on Dan Holiday replying to a letter he received at Box 13. He would generally solve a mystery in the process, and return to his office in time to enjoy a hearty laugh at the expense of Suzy, his amusingly stupid secretary. He would certainly not meet the strictest requirements for private eyes (not licensed, collected no fees from clients), but the definition should stretch to sneak him in under the rope. In total there were 52 episodes of this radio program created. It was heard over the Mutual Broadcasting System as well as being syndicated. The series was produced by Mayfair Productions. <i>Box 13</i>, starring Alan Ladd as Dan Holiday. Sylvia Picker played Suzy, Dan Holiday's secretary and Edmond MacDonald as Lt. Kling. Other stars in the series were Betty Lou Gerson, Lurene Tuttle, Alan Reed, Luis Van Rooten, John Beal and Frank Lovejoy. Music was by Rudy Schrager and the writer was Russell Hughes. Announcer/Director was Vern Carstensen. The series was produced by Richard Sanville with Alan Ladd as co-producer. From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">HELLO AMERICANS</font></b></u></i></p> <i>Hello Americans</i> was a 12 episode show Orson Welles made as another contribution to the war effort, and stems in part from his interest in Latin and South American culture. It was no doubt spurred by his time in Brazil working on the movie <i>It's All True</i>. The show is a generally lighthearted affair, and Welles clearly seems to enjoy himself. The first episode in particular, with Carmen Miranda, is a prime example of this. <i>Hello Americans</i> did have some more serious moments, and despite some lapses into melodramatics, most were carried off reasonably well. The show is peppered with numerous editorial insertions, pertaining mainly to racism, although the odd barb against fascism pops up now and again. What is perhaps most worthwhile about the show is its portrayal of Central and South America countries as full of interesting history and people, with little condescension.

The program was first broadcast in 1944 on the Mutual Network, and switched between that and NBC over the decade it was on the air. The show was originally sponsored by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, and later Miles Laboratories, Quaker Oats, Post Toasties and Dodge automobiles financed this popular evening western adventure. Roy Rogers, the \"King of the Cowboys\" in the movies, was the star. Naturally, his iconic steed Trigger played a big role on the series, as did Roy's group the Sons of the Pioneers, who originally provided the vocal music along with Roy and the lovely Pat Friday. A year later, Roy's new wife and co-star Dale Evans joined the program (along with her horse Buttermilk), as did the Riders of the Purple Sage and Foy Willing. Roy's comical sidekicks included former Sons of the Pioneers member Pat Brady and the legendary Gabby Hayes, as well as Forrest Lewis, who portrayed the wisest trail scout of them all, Jonah Wilde. The show was transcribed from the outset, as Roy's contractual obligations precluded him from performing live. The program's original opening theme was \"It's Round-Up Time on the Double-R-Bar\", which was also the name of Roy's fictional ranch in Paradise Valley on the series. This was later supplanted by the famous \"Happy Trails\" song, written by Dale Evans. Roy would often close the show, in reference to his Christian beliefs, with the phrase âGoodbye, good luck, and may the good Lord take a likin' to ya.â <font size=\"-2\">The information in this synopsis was culled from Radio's Golden Age by Vincent Terrace and On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio by John Dunning.</font> From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

It was initially broadcast on radio from 1935 to 1953, and later on television from 1952 to 1957. Originally on CBS, then later changing to NBC, the series pioneered the use of anthology drama for company audio advertising. <i>The Cavalcade of America</i> documented historical events using stories of individual courage, initiative and achievement, often with feel-good dramatizations of the human spirit's triumph against all odds. This was consistent with Du Pont's overall conservative philosophy and legacy as an American company dating back to 1802. The company's motto, \"Maker of better things for better living through chemistry,\" was read at the beginning of each program, and the dramas emphasized humanitarian progress, particularly improvements in the lives of women, often through technological innovation. Martin Grams, Jr. is the author of the highly-acclaimed publication, \"The History of the Cavalcade of America\", the authorized guide to the history of the popular radio/television series. The 500 page book is available from all major bookstores, including Amazon.com and Borders.com. This book comes highly recommended. It served as an invaluable resource with determining correct titles of episodes. It features an extensive episode guide.

During the 15 minute show Hank and the announcer Louie Buck would pitch the flour in between Hank's songs. Hank even wrote a theme song for the show. <blockquote> I love to have that gal around Her bicuits are so nice and brown Her pies and cakes beat all the rest Cause she makes them all with Mother's Best </blockquote> Hank was paid $100 a week for five shows. Often times, they were pre-recorded due to Hank's touring schedule. These shows are among Hank Williams most popular, if not his best, work. Perhaps the most well known, most sought collection in the Hank Williams catalogue are the <i>Mother's Best</i> radio shows. This collection of radio shows is considered by many to be Hank's best work and were done at the peak of his career in 1951. The show was broadcast live between 7:15 and 7:30 a.m. on WSM out of Nashville, Tennessee. Some of the shows were pre-recorded to be played on the air when Hank was out on the road. Hank was paid $100 a week for recording the shows that usually consisted of one country song, one instrumental and a gospel song to close the show, but that's not all they have to offer. The <i>Mother's Best</i> Shows capture Hank's personality better than anything else known to exist and they don't paint the picture of a sad, lonesome, forlorn man hell bent on drinking and death as many books and other publications try to portray him as. In fact, it is probably the in-between song chatter that makes these recordings so great, you get a glimpse of what Hank Williams was like as a person. The <i>Mother's Best</i> shows also featured a surprising variety of hymns, since there was at least one in every early-morning broadcast. A lesser-known Hank-penned uptempo jubilee number, \"I'm Gonna Sing\", is a highlight -- but so is his surprising three-part harmony singing with Drifting Cowboys Jerry Rivers and Cedric Rainwater on the likes of \"I Hear My Savior Calling Me\". Those expecting all lonesome barroom ballads and joking marital complaints should know that there's a lot of the gospel side of Hank on these discs. He shows a particular appreciation for songs by his Louisiana Hayride and Opry buddies the Bailes Brothers â \"Dust On The Bible\" and \"I've Got My One-Way Ticket To The Sky\", for instance. The Bailes' influence on Hank may have been as potent as that of Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. For all of the solemn spirituality, there's plenty of joking, in any case. We still hear Williams inform his female audience, \"Hey good lookin', if you've got anything cookin', just make sure you're cookin' it with Mother's Best Flour.\" This is a Hank very much in the world of his moment; he mentions the current pop hit version of \"On Top Of Old Smoky\" (it was by the Weavers) before launching into a great hard country version himself as an answer. <font size=\"-2\">(Some material for this series synopsis is from www.nodepression.com, and www.geocities.com/mothersbestshows. )</font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

References to the Ranch Boys are found as early as 1930, though they may have been on earlier. They broadcast over KTM those first few years, nearly every day and at various times. Jack Ross, a versatile actor and producer apparently served as Pinto Pete, with Joe \"Curley\" Bradley and Ken \"Shorty\" Carson rounding out the trio. All three had acted as stuntmen. They also appeared in a few movies, including <i>It Happened One Night</i> and <i>In Old Monterey</i>. The first recorded notice of the <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Pinto_Pete_and_His_Ranch_Boys\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pinto Pete and His Ranch Boys</a> that researcher Ben Kibler was able to locate was a December 13, 1933 broadcast in Sandusky, Ohio. Mentions of the broadcast appeared through 1936. In 1935, they auditioned for the Tom Mix radio show in Chicago and Curley got the part of \"Pecos\", Ross got the lead of \"Tom Mix\", and Carson was to play bit parts. But Ross only got to play Mix once. While in Hollywood doing some movies in the summer of 1938, they rode their horses from Hollywood to Chicago in a publicity stunt that landed them on <i>National Barn Dance</i> for three months. Researcher Ryan Ellett perused the Los Angeles Times from 1930 to 1935 and turned up a few mentions that indicate the trio might have moved on to better pastures. Producer Grace Gibson introduced Australia to <i>Pinto Pete And The Ranch Boys</i> about 1934, according to researcher Ian Grieves, and the program was heard off and on through 1944.

It was broadcast over the Columbia Don Lee Coast radio network. The schedule was 3 nights a week, Sunday, Wednesday and Friday at 7:45 PM (6:45 during summer daylight savings time). The sponsor was Ex-Lax. In late September 1935 the show changed to two shows per week, dropping the Sunday show. In late September 1936 the schedule changed again to Tuesday and Friday nights. A 1936 booklet of the <i>Strange As It Seems</i> stories was sponsored by Ex-Lax and given away as a free promotion of the radio program by writing to the station. The show was hosted by Gayne Whitman, produced and directed by Cyril Armbrister and the music was composed and directed by Felix Mills. Whitman had been the announcer on the <i>Strange As It Seems</i> movie shorts from 1930 - 1934. The programs included 2 or 3 segments of dramatized events in mini plays with dramatic, fanfare music interspersed in the show between segments. After the opening line, an Ex-Lax commercial would follow. Then 2 or 3 strange stories would be presented. The show would conclude with a preview of the next show's stories, an Ex-Lax commercial, a strange fact of trivia, such as \"Butterflies smell with their feet\" and finally a short musical ending. There were occasionally live interviews with unusual personalities, such as the World's Fastest Talker. Many of the programs were distributed on 16\" 33 RPM records with one 15 minute show on each side. Many sources list at least 39 of these records with a total of 78 programs recorded. This run of the shows concluded at the end of January 1937, after over 210 shows. The show began again in January 1938 as a 15 minute once a week program, airing on Sunday afternoons at 3:00 (2:00 during daylight savings time). The show ended at the end of December 1938, with 53 shows in this run. The <i>Strange As It Seems</i> radio program was picked up as a 30 minute network program on the CBS network from August 17, 1939 to Dec. 26, 1940 on Thursdays at 8:30 P.M.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">REDBOOK DRAMAS</font></b></u></i></p> This series, based upon short stories originally published in Redbook Magazine, was aired in the year 1932. The United States was then in the grip of the Great Depression, and several of the episodes reflect that phenomenon. \"He Knew Women\" and \"Kiss and Jail,\" for example, feature families which have been devastated by the stock market crash and its aftermath. As if to counteract the country's grim circumstances, however, many of the stories offer \"love, mystery, adventure, romance\" in sometimes exotic settings. Listeners are transported to such places as Yucatan, France, Dalmatia and Manchuria and encounter some remarkable characters and circumstances along the way. These include a surly Army private who gets in trouble when his pet goat butts a brigadier general into a mud puddle; an American schoolteacher who becomes involved in a political intrigue abroad and temporarily represents herself as a collector of coffins; and an intrepid little domestic servant with Holmes-like powers of observation who solves a murder case at a frozen outpost beyond the Arctic Circle. Some of the authors are noteworthy as well. For example Elaine Carrington, who wrote \"The Kid,\" is well remembered today as creator of the famous radio soap operas <i>When a Girl Marries</i> and <i>Pepper Young's Family</i>. And Frank R. Adams, whose \"A Gent Passes By\" delivers a knockout sequence of startling revelations, displays the skill that enabled him to publish dozens of short stories in popular magazines of the day such as Munsey's and The Smart Set. These syndicated episodes are all fifteen minutes in length, and some could have benefited from more time to develop plot and character. But the best of them convey to us an intense flavor of their times, often with charming musical interludes and bridges, from a broadcast year that has left us with all too few programs to enjoy.

In it, Frank played Rocky Fortune, a \"footloose and fancy-free young man,\" frequently unemployed, who took numerous, adventurous odd jobs. It was a relatively undistinguished series; definitely a \"B grade\" radio series, saved by Sinatra's charm and a tongue-in-cheek approach. <i>Rocky Fortune</i> appeared on NBC for only a short run of 25 or 26 shows. The lead character, who goes by the name of Rocky Fortune but whose real name is Rocko Fortunato, was played by Frank Sinatra. Rocky, always ready with a wise remark, seems to be a magnet for trouble, most often with the variety of odd jobs he takes. There is frequently a beautiful woman involved, some good girls, some bad. Rocky's a tough guy who stays just inside of the law but we get an occasional glimpse of a soft heart beneath the hard exterior. It's a character that Mr. Sinatra plays nicely. Employed or not, Rocky possesed a variety of skills. During the course of the series, he worked as a process server, museum tour guide, cabbie, bodyguard, chauffeur, truck driver, social director for a Catskills resort and a carny. He could also fake enough bass to play at weddings and bar-mitzvahs. For most of the series, Rocky received his job assignments from the Gridley Employment Agency, usually referred to as just \"the agency\". The only recurring character, throughout the series, besides Rocky himself, is the long-suffering Sergeant Hamilton J. Finger - a solid, although not-too-bright cop who works out of what is frequently referred to as \"the Irish clubhouse,\" who seemed to be constantly running into Rocky, whether he wanted to or not. At about the same time, November 10, 1953 to July 9, 1954, Sinatra also starred in a musical show on NBC called <i>To Be Perfectly Frank</i>. And, no matter how you look at it, <i>Rocky Fortune</i> was really just another chance for the ever-ambitious Sinatra to be himself, and to promote his career. \"From Here To Eternity\" had opened that August, and Sinatra used the series to promote the film (and his Oscar nomination). As the series wound to a close and the date of the Academy Awards presentation drew near, it became a running gag that Rocky seemed to work the phrase \"from here to eternity\" into almost every show. Fortunately for his career, his Oscar for his role in Eternity came and rescued him from all this. Most scripts were written by Ernest Kinoy and George Lefferts, who also wrote <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Dimension_X\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dimension X</a> and <i>X Minus One</i> scripts. (Frequently, the same music bridges can be heard for <i>X Minus One</i> in early espisodes of this series.) Fred Weihe and Andrew Love directed.

As originally created by author Jack Boyle, he was a safecracker -- a hardened criminal who had served time in a California prison. Prowling the underworld as a detective in adaptations for films, radio, and television, the detective Boston Blackie was \"an enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend\". The <i>Boston Blackie</i> radio series, starring Chester Morris, began June 23, 1944, on NBC as a summer replacement for <i>The Amos 'n' Andy Show</i>. Sponsored by Rinso, the series continued until September 15 of that year. Unlike the concurrent films, Blackie had a steady romantic interest in the radio show -- Lesley Woods appeared as Blackie's girlfriend Mary Wesley. Harlow Wilcox was the show's announcer. On April 11, 1945, Richard Kollmar took over the title role in a radio series syndicated by Frederic W. Ziv to Mutual and other network outlets. Over 200 episodes of this series were produced between 1944 and October 25, 1950. Other sponsors included Lifebuoy Soap, Champagne Velvet beer, and R&H beer. While investigating mysteries, Blackie invaribly encountered harebrained Police Inspector Farraday (Maurice Tarplin) and always solved the mystery to Farraday's amazement. Initially, friction surfaced in the relationship between Blackie and Farraday, but as the series continued, Farraday recognized Blackie's talents and requested assistance. Blackie dated Mary Wesley (Jan Miner), and for the first half of the series, his best pal Shorty was always on hand.

The series had a generous budget from its network, CBS. In 1948 the series had become popular enough that it was decided to broadcast for a complete hour, instead of the former thirty minutes. The actor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_%28actor%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Montgomery</a> was brought in to introduce the plays, replacing the \"Man in Black\" character and occasionally star in them. This format lasted only six months most probably due to the realization that the show worked best within a thirty minute framework. It was at this time that William Spier left and over the years others came to produce the shows, each setting his own unique mark. Anton M. Leader, who came from producing another horror radio program, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_at_Midnight_%28radio_series%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Murder_at_Midnight</a>, added some lighter <i>SUSPENSE</i> stories which focused more on the central characters.

He also was not afraid to experiment using the series slot for classic \"murder\" stories such as \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello\" rel=\"nofollow\">Othello</a>.\" The series continued to produce high-quality drama, though there were many repeats as well as borrowing of scripts from other radio shows. While a number of film actors continued to star occasionally, many of the stars were from radio and television since radio as a dramatic art form was beginning to lose its popularity and budgets were tightened. The show was on the air for a little over twenty years beginning in January, 1942 and was rarely pre-empted. There were 947 performances. Nearly all (approximately 895) are available to collectors. When <i>SUSPENSE</i> left the air, radio was never to see the likes of such a series again. Now the great medium of radio where imagination can run free has been reduced to the occasional brilliant drama airing sporadically in some corner of the world. <i>SUSPENSE</i> was a golden moment in a golden age. A moment when the thrill of the nightime led the listener along the path of intrigue, horror and dangerous adventure.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">CHALLENGE OF THE YUKON</font></b></u></i></p> <i>Challenge of the Yukon</i> was a long-running radio series that began on Detroit's station WXYZ (as had <i>The Lone Ranger</i> and <i>The Green Hornet</i>), and an example of a Northern genre story. The series was first heard on February 3, 1938. The program was an adventure series about Sergeant William Preston of the Northwest Mounted Police and his lead sled dog, Yukon King, as they fought evildoers in the Northern wilderness during the Gold Rush of the 1890s. Preston, according to radio historian Jim Harmon, first joined the Mounties to capture his father's killer, and when he was successful he was promoted to Sergeant. Preston worked under the command of Inspector Conrad, and in the early years was often assisted by a French-Canadian guide named Pierre. Preston's staunchest ally, who was arguably the true star of the show and indeed often did more work than he did, was the brave Alaskan husky, Yukon King. Typical plots involved the pair helping injured trappers, tracking down smugglers, or saving cabin dwellers from wolverines. Sgt. Preston's faithful steed was Rex, used primarily in the summer months, but generally Yukon King and his dog team were the key mode of transportation (as signalled by Preston's cry of \"On, King! On, you huskies!.\" There is some confusion regarding King's actual breed. The producers seemed to use malamute and husky interchangeably. At least once, Preston answered \"malamute\" to the question from another character. In the early radio shows, the cry of \"On, you huskies!\" would alternate with \"On, you malamutes\" from show to show. Von Reznicek's Donna Diana Overture was the pulsing theme music, and the episodes ended with the official pronouncement, Well, King, this case is closed. Following the success of <i>The Lone Ranger</i> and <i>The Green Hornet</i>, George W. Trendle, the station owner, asked for a similar adventure show, but with a dog as the hero. According to WXYZ staffer Dick Osgood, in his history of the station, Trendle insisted that it not be \"a dog like Lassie because.. this must be an action story. It had to be a working dog.\" Writer Tom Dougall, who had been influenced by the poems of Robert W. Service, naturally chose a Husky. The dog was originally called Mogo, but after criticism by Trendle, Dougall re-christened the canine King. Dougall likewise created Sgt. Preston and the French-Canadian guide. Fran Striker, who wrote for <i>The Lone Ranger</i>, also contributed scripts. However, Trendle's criticism of Dougall may have had another reason behind it. Shortly before the two Trendle series aired (<i> The Lone Ranger</i> and <i>Challenge of the Yukon</i>), popular author Zane Grey had a book in circulation (Lone Star Ranger) about a Texas Ranger like <i>The Lone Ranger</i> and a comic book series in circulation (King of the Royal Mounted) about the adventures of Sgt. King, a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman like Sgt. Preston. It could be that Trendle borrowed both ideas from Grey's work and wanted to retain the name \"King\" as a tribute to Grey, who died after a long illness one year following the first airing of <i>Challenge of the Yukon</i>. <i>Challenge of the Yukon</i> began as a 15-minute serial, airing locally from 1938 until May 28, 1947. Shortly thereafter, the program acquired a sponsor, Quaker Oats, and the series, in a half-hour format, moved to the networks. The program aired on ABC from June 12, 1947 to December 30, 1949. It was then heard on The Mutual Broadcasting System from January 2, 1950 through the final broadcast on June 9, 1955. The title changed from <i>Challenge of the Yukon</i> to Sergeant Preston of the Yukon in November 1951, and remained under that name through the end of the series and into television. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

It followed the problems and the successes, big and small, of an average newly-married couple, including the need for thrift, having an overhanded mother-in-law, and all those charming little moments of life. The program began as a skit on <i>The Kate Smith Hour</i> in 1941, and was expanded into a full summer series a month later. In those original shows, Claudia was played by Patricia Ryan and David by Richard Kollmar. Franken and MeloneyÃ¢s stories were collected into books that were adapted into a pair of RKO films, <i>Claudia</i> in 1943 and <i>Claudia and David</i> in 1946. Both films starred Robert Young and Dorothy McGuire. The success of the films prompted Coca-Cola to sponsor a 15-minute syndicated weekday radio program in the 1947-1948 season, starring Kathryn Bard and Paul Crabtree. The Claudia and David stories also spawned two TV movies in the late fifties, as well as British and German television adaptations. <font size=\"-2\"></font> From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">REDBOOK DRAMAS</font></b></u></i></p> This series, based upon short stories originally published in Redbook Magazine, was aired in the year 1932. The United States was then in the grip of the Great Depression, and several of the episodes reflect that phenomenon. \"He Knew Women\" and \"Kiss and Jail,\" for example, feature families which have been devastated by the stock market crash and its aftermath. As if to counteract the country's grim circumstances, however, many of the stories offer \"love, mystery, adventure, romance\" in sometimes exotic settings. Listeners are transported to such places as Yucatan, France, Dalmatia and Manchuria and encounter some remarkable characters and circumstances along the way. These include a surly Army private who gets in trouble when his pet goat butts a brigadier general into a mud puddle; an American schoolteacher who becomes involved in a political intrigue abroad and temporarily represents herself as a collector of coffins; and an intrepid little domestic servant with Holmes-like powers of observation who solves a murder case at a frozen outpost beyond the Arctic Circle. Some of the authors are noteworthy as well. For example Elaine Carrington, who wrote \"The Kid,\" is well remembered today as creator of the famous radio soap operas <i>When a Girl Marries</i> and <i>Pepper Young's Family</i>. And Frank R. Adams, whose \"A Gent Passes By\" delivers a knockout sequence of startling revelations, displays the skill that enabled him to publish dozens of short stories in popular magazines of the day such as Munsey's and The Smart Set. These syndicated episodes are all fifteen minutes in length, and some could have benefited from more time to develop plot and character. But the best of them convey to us an intense flavor of their times, often with charming musical interludes and bridges, from a broadcast year that has left us with all too few programs to enjoy. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Redbook Dramas <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>June 1, 2008 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Consisting of thirteen 15 minute episodes, it was provided to local Rotary Clubs for broadcast on local stations. In conjunction, thirteen discussion scripts were also offered to be used as follow-up broadcasts or for use as program and educational material where local broadcast might not be possible. Broadcast from March 1, 1955 through March 18, 1955, five times a week. Each episode featured a different situation involving persons with a problem, with the solution being provided by the Rotary Club. Typical of the recordings is “Youth, Yesterday and Today”. Originally broadcast on March 15, 1955, it deals with a former convict who gathers a gang of underprivileged youths and trains them to steal automobile accessories. Through a Rotarian druggist, through whom one of the young men is employed, the Rotary Club becomes aware of the situation, finds a way to appeal to the boy’s better nature, and through a series of highly dramatic sequences, the Rotary Club helps the police catch the former convict. The program ends with many of the boys being rehabilitated and finding lives of useful purpose. The program may seem to be dated, but the moral implications come across loud and clear. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Rotary Golden Theater <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>April 16, 2006 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Numerous magazines of \"True Crime Stories\" filled the newsstands. Radio also helped fill the need with fictional heroes such as <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Yours_Truly_Johnny_Dollar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnny Dollar</a> and <i>The Saint</i>. Few true crime dramas, other than <i>Gangbusters</i> or <i>Dragnet</i>, sustained long term success on radio. The Secrets of Scotland Yardwas a successful crime drama series, initially airing internationally between 1949 and 1951. Selected episodes finally came to a US radio network for a brief run much later in 1957 over the Mutual Broadcasting System. The series boasted well over 100 episodes, one of which, \"The Bone From A Voice Box\", apparently served as the prototype for another well remembered Towers Of London dramatic series, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Black_Museum\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Black Museum</a>. In both series, well known actors were employed as host / narrator, Orson Welles in <i>The Black Museum</i> and Clive Brook here. In fact, the shows were so similar that some of the same actual Scotland Yard cases were dramatized for both series (with totally different scripts, and casts). <i>The Secrets of Scotland Yard</i> was an independent production of the Towers of London syndicate in England for world wide distribution. Each week, an audience of anxious radio-listeners tuned in to hear these true crime stories of the London Metropolitan Police unfold, as the detectives at the Yard investigated some of England’s most famous criminals. Their trials have become legendary. Stories presented in the series include the theft of the British crown jewels by Colonel Thomas Blood; the story of a man who finds an armless and legless body wrapped in ribbons and lace; or the strange story of two close brothers who love one another enough to contemplate the murder of a brother’s affluent, yet unsightly and ignorant, wife. Murders, forgery, and robberies all get a through review on the program. Each time, Scotland Yard detectives are afoot to solve the crime mystery! <i>The Secrets of Scotland Yard</i> was initially hosted by Clive Brook, probably for the first year or so. To add to the air of authenticity, Brook sometimes discusses matters with Percy Hoskins, a 1950s crime expert and reporter for the London Daily Express. Hoskins knew every nook and cranny in London’s seedier districts and personally reported on many of the major crimes of the day. A student of crime, Hoskins was also one of the founders of the Saints and Sinners Club of London, an educational organization dedicated to true crime investigation methods and results. Brook had his own Scotland Yard experience previously when he played retired naval commander Stevenson in the 1936 film, \"Scotland Yard Commands\". American audiences will however probably more familiar with Brooks’ portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes in the 1932 film of the same name. Brook was eventually replaced by an actor portraying the character Superintendent X of Scotland Yard. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Secrets of Scotland Yard <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>December 17, 2006 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 3 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">THE HILLBILLY BOYS</font></b></u></i></p> W. Lee O'Daniel's musical career began in January 1931, when a West Texas fiddler named James Robert (Bob) Wills entered his Fort Worth office at Burrus Mill and Elevator Company. As general manager of the firm, O'Daniel had just canceled a radio program on which Wills and his fiddle band had been advertising Burrus Mill's Light Crust Flour. O'Daniel canceled it, as he said, \"because I didn't like their hillbilly music.\" So many cards and letters came into station KFJZ that O'Daniel had to put the show back on the air, and the band became known as the Light Crust Doughboys. When O'Daniel realized how much flour the show was selling, he became the announcer for the show and manager of the band. According to Wills, O'Daniel was an asset to the show. He had a flair for dramatization and publicity; he wrote poems and read them on the air and often had the band work out music for them. Though his songs never became national hits, they became known throughout Texas and the Southwest. He wrote \"Beautiful Texas,\" \"Put Me in Your Pocket,\" and a song for Franklin D. Roosevelt's war on the Great Depression, \"On to Victory Mr. Roosevelt\" (all in 1933). The Doughboy broadcast became one of the most popular and longlived shows in the history of the Southwest. The original Light Crust Doughboy show consisted of O'Daniel as announcer, Bob Wills on fiddle, Herman Arnspiger on guitar, and Milton Brown as vocalist. By the mid-1930s all had left the Doughboys, and each eventually had an important place in Texas music. In 1935 Burrus Mill fired O'Daniel, and he organized his own band, <i>The Hillbilly Boys</i>, and his own flour company, W. Lee O'Daniel Flour Company, manufacturers of Hillbilly Flour. Between September 1935 and December 1938 O'Daniel and the Hillbilly Boys did six recording sessions for Vocalion (later part of Columbia Records). Some of their recordings were far from hillbilly music; in general, they represent some of the best western swing that any band in the Fort Worth-Dallas area ever recorded. As a vocalist, Leon Huff was at his best on these recordings, consistently better than when he later recorded for Bob and Johnnie Lee Wills. Kitty Williamson, whom O'Daniel called Texas Rose, vocalized on several recordings. She was probably the first female singer in western swing; her recording of \"Baby Won't You Please Come Home\" was in the Bessie Smith tradition and was vocalized western swing at its best. Although some of his recordings were hillbilly, it was on his radio shows that O'Daniel promoted a hillbilly façade. His famous \"Pass the Biscuits Pappy\" smacked of the hillbilly and made the show, Hillbilly Flour, and O'Daniel popular. He read poems and gave brief lectures on morality, most of which he never practiced, according to his musicians. O'Daniel had bigger and more important things in mind than his hillbilly music, however. In 1938 he became a candidate for governor of Texas. He was probably the first candidate anywhere in the nation to use a fiddle band (or perhaps any kind of a band) as a principal part of a political campaign. He toured the state with his Hillbilly Boys, who began his rallies by playing \"Beautiful Texas\" (which O'Daniel strategically recorded the year before). After the band drew the crowd, O'Daniel gave a campaign speech. Then he sent members of his family and the band into the audience with miniature flour barrels to accept campaign contributions. The method was successful, though no one will ever know how much so, since the donations were all in cash. When he was elected governor, O'Daniel took his Hillbilly Boys with him to Austin and got all of them jobs with the state. For example, Kermit Whalin, a barber, became a state barber inspector. The musicians broadcast a show from the Governor's Mansionqv on Sundays, and so continued to build the image of Governor O'Daniel and keep his name before the people. Most of the musicians never saw the inside of the mansion; they played the show on the front porch and were never invited inside. When O'Daniel's daughter, Molly, married, he sent band member Jim Boyd and his wife an engraved invitation, but Boyd said, \"They stopped us at the church door and wouldn't let us in.\" When O'Daniel became a United States senator, he insisted that the band go with him to Washington but refused to tell them what salary they would receive. If they refused to go, they lost their state jobs immediately, and Jim Boyd was even evicted from his state-owned home. Practically every musician who played for O'Daniel believed he was selfish, unfair, and extremely ruthless. Aside from his politics and his personal qualities, O'Daniel was important in the music of Texas when it was in its formative years. Without his remarkable ability to promote and publicize, the innovative music of the Light Crust Doughboys might never have gained such vast popularity, and men like Bob Wills might have been known only in North and Central Texas. As governor, O'Daniel made the world aware that there was a distinctive Texas sound and that music was important enough to help a flour salesman attain the highest office in the state.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY</font></b></u></i></p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia <i>Mr. District Attorney</i> is a popular radio crime drama, produced by Samuel Bischoff, which aired on NBC and ABC from April 3, 1939 to June 13, 1952 (and in transcribed syndication through 1953). The series focused on a crusading D.A., initially known only as \"Mister District Attorney,\" or \"Chief\", and was later translated to television. On television the D.A. had a name, Paul Garrett, and the radio version picked up this name in the final years when David Brian played the role. A key figure in the dramas was the D.A.'s secretary, Edith Miller (Vicki Vola). Created, written, and directed by former law student Ed Byron, the series was inspired by the early years of New York governor Thomas E. Dewey. It was Dewey's public war against racketeering which led to his election as governor. Phillips H. Lord, creator of <i>Gangbusters</i>, helped to develop the concept and coined the title. Byron lent an air of accuracy and immediacy to his scripts through close study of crime statistics, a library of criminology texts, following the newspapers, and even going around rough bars to gain tips, background, and color from crooks and police alike. His techniques sometimes enabled Byron to predict major crime waves before the news broke. Produced throughout its run in New York City, the series began as a fifteen minute serial, becoming a half hour, self-contained series three months later. During 1942, Mr. District Attorney began battling Nazis, leading to conflicts with the FBI when the scripts reflected life too closely. Cast and characters: <b>Mr. District Attorney</b> - The nameless title role was played by several actors throughout the run, with the breakdown as follows: Dwight Weist (1939 serials); Raymond Edward Johnson (1939 half hour shows); Jay Jostyn (1940 through 1952 - Jostyn also guest starred in the role in mystery sketches for the game show <i>Quick as a Flash</i>); David Brian (1952-1953 syndication). <b>Voice of the Law</b> - The show's signature was the opening announcer, known as the \"Voice of the Law,\" who defined the creed and duties of Mr. District Attorney.

Ironically, the episode was titled \"Devil Stone\" and was the last dramatic radio play from a series that had its roots in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-time_radio\" rel=\"nofollow\">golden age of radio. </a>. What began as a \"new series frankly dedicated to your horrification and entertainment\" took on a life of its own mostly due to the talents of some outstanding producers and adaptations and original stories from the cream of mystery writers of the time. The golden age of radio was truly the golden age of <i>SUSPENSE</i> as show after show broadcast outstanding plays which were \"calculated to intrigue...stir [the] nerves.\" It was the series' first producer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Spier\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Spier</a>, who set the framework of rules that was to stay with the show for most of its run. Mr. Spier determined that the series should deal with life-and-death situations established near the beginning of each play and then through the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bernard_Herrmann</a>'s musical coloring and the writer's characterizations slowly tighten the knot of <i>SUSPENSE</i>. Many of the early stories were written by the mystery writer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dickson_Carr\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Dickson Carr</a>. Others were by such fine writers as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Fletcher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Fletcher</a>, whose <i>SUSPENSE</i> play, \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry,_Wrong_Number#Radio_play\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sorry, Wrong Number</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1943/Suspense_430525_043_Sorry_Wrong_Number_128-44_28100_29m17s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/download)</a> was turned into a major motion picture; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Arthur,_Jr.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Arthur</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Richards\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert L. Richards</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton_Fine\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morton Fine</a> and David Friedkin.

But what foreboding does the hitchhiker hold for the driver? Another rule William Spier established was to make the series a place to hear the talents of Hollywood's famous actors. There rarely was a famous actor who did not appear on the series at some time. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Stewart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jimmy_Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cary Grant</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Humphrey Bogart</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Ball</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olivia de Havilland</a> and many others all made at least one appearance. The series had a generous budget from its network, CBS. In 1948 the series had become popular enough that it was decided to broadcast for a complete hour, instead of the former thirty minutes. The actor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_%28actor%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Montgomery</a> was brought in to introduce the plays, replacing the \"Man in Black\" character and occasionally star in them. This format lasted only six months most probably due to the realization that the show worked best within a thirty minute framework. It was at this time that William Spier left and over the years others came to produce the shows, each setting his own unique mark. Anton M. Leader, who came from producing another horror radio program, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_at_Midnight_%28radio_series%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Murder_at_Midnight</a>, added some lighter <i>SUSPENSE</i> stories which focused more on the central characters. Jimmy Stewart appeared in an excellent story about a paralysed war veteran who thinks he has found the man who imprisoned and tortured him. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fibber McGee and Molly</a> appeared in a tale about a killer on the loose in \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1949/Suspense_490203_326_Backseat_Driver_128-44_28499_30m03s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backseat Driver</a>.\" Probably the biggest change in <i>SUSPENSE</i> came under the producing eye of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Lewis_%28radio%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elliott Lewis</a>. Lewis brought in comic actors to play serious roles. Actors such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Benny\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Benny</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Skelton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Skelton</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzie_Nelson\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ozzie Nelson</a>. He also was not afraid to experiment using the series slot for classic \"murder\" stories such as \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello\" rel=\"nofollow\">Othello</a>.\" The series continued to produce high-quality drama, though there were many repeats as well as borrowing of scripts from other radio shows. While a number of film actors continued to star occasionally, many of the stars were from radio and television since radio as a dramatic art form was beginning to lose its popularity and budgets were tightened. The show was on the air for a little over twenty years beginning in January, 1942 and was rarely pre-empted. There were 947 performances. Nearly all (approximately 895) are available to collectors. When <i>SUSPENSE</i> left the air, radio was never to see the likes of such a series again. Now the great medium of radio where imagination can run free has been reduced to the occasional brilliant drama airing sporadically in some corner of the world. <i>SUSPENSE</i> was a golden moment in a golden age. A moment when the thrill of the nightime led the listener along the path of intrigue, horror and dangerous adventure.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">SINGLES AND DOUBLES COLLECTION Volume 2</font></b></u></i></p> This is a work in progress. This OTRR Collection is a Non-Certified one, containing series in which currently only one or two episodes are known to exist -- hence the name: \"Singles and Doubles Collection\". Almost every type genre is included. Radio -- called by some <i>The Theater of the Mind</i> -- has been with us since 1920 when stations WWJ of Detroit and KDKA of Pittsburg made the first regular commercial broadcasts. The first program aimed at entertaining the unseen audience followed close behind. Over the years since then, literally thousands of series have been broadcast nationally and thousands more in regional or local markets. Some endured for a few years, others for 20 or 30, and some unfortunately only had one episode broadcast. Of those thousands, some series saw some of their episodes saved for the future, some saw nearly all and others only one or two episodes. While the goal of the Old Time Radio Researchers Group is to preserve radios past by collecting, and archiving as many different series as possible and making them available to the community, we do not want to let the series that only had a minimum number of episodes to survive go unpreserved for future generations. To that end we have put together this unique collection of series. Most of the programs you will find here will be totally unfamilar to you, but they are informative and entertaining none the less. This is the second version of this collection that we have released. Since the first collection new broadcasts have surfaced, and others will undoubtely be found in the future. When and if that occurs, we will release a version three. From comedy to drama to cooking shows to music, you'll hear it all here, and every episode will be unique and different. They run the gamut, from the middle 20s to the early 70s, all showing us a glimpse of the past, when things were slower and families gathered round the radio each evening. Times when each person was hearing the same thing, but created a different picture in their minds of what the characters looked like, the scenery, location, and most important the sounds. Sounds that each found a different meaning in, but one that entertained, educated, and made the world a smaller place, where you could hear those stories that in the past were told to just a few, gathered round the dinner table, at a campfire, or in small audiences, but now the whole world could hear and enjoy. Some of these episodes may be misnamed or misdated. If you find such, please let us know. Additionally there may be some dead air space at the beginning or ending of some episodes. This is not one of our certified sets, it is being provided as a way to obtain those series in which only one or two shows have survived. From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

The series aired as a horror drama on NBC between 1941 and 1942. <i>Dark Fantasy</i> was a series dedicated to dealings with the unknown. Originating from radio station WKY, Oklahoma City, it was written by Scott Bishop (of <i>Mysterious Traveler</i> and <i>The Sealed Book</i> fame) and was heard Fridays over stations. Tom Paxton served as announcer. The shows covered horror, science fiction and murder mysteries. Although a short series, the shows are excellent with some stories way ahead of their time. The following is a news promo promoting the show: Every since <i>Lights Out</i> went out several years ago, fans of the fiendish have been clamoring for more good old goose-pimple horror drama on the air. Now they have it. One of the programs that currently freezes the airwaves with its chilling stories is <i>Dark Fantasy</i> comparatively new to the networks. In the late hours of Friday nights these shivery, shocking stories go out over NBC - right straight from Oklahoma City, which you might not have thought of as headquarters for haunts. Station WKY is the home of the <i>Dark Fantasy</i> plays, and the writer is Scott Bishop, who lives in the midst of mystery and the supernatural, represented by the innurnerable volumes of thriller fiction, fantasy lore and all kinds of horror literature that fill his home andhis office. Bishop has long contributed to network broadcasting and to magazines. He says, \"Give the listener enough material to let his imagination go to work, and he'll supply his own goose-pimples.\" <i>Dark Fantasy</i> has been furnishing plenty of such material since last November. And judging from enthusiastic comment, the horror fans are responding with goose-pimples galore! Tune in every Friday on Station WKY Oklahoma City. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

It’s a friendly little town - home to a pub, a general store, a service station and, up on the hill, the southernmost communication satellite station of American communication giant, Koestler Industries. Thompson is an American holidaying in New Zealand after his breakup nearly led to a breakdown. He receives a message from his employers that there’s a problem at the station up north, and that since he’s there, he should check it out. The problem is \"a problem doesn’t even begin to describe it\".

Each episode was about 12 minutes long and the series was probably aimed at the youth market. It is not to be confused with the US show - 'The Henry Morgan Show'. It was produced by and starred George Edwards, who also produced Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Frankenstein, Corsican Brothers, and Son of Porthos, all Australian series as well. We believe that Maurice Francis, an enthusiastic writer, and Nell Sterling, two of George Edwards long-time collaborators, were also featured in 'Afloat With Henry Morgan'. To save money, Edwards played a variety of different roles and became known as 'the Man With A Thousand Voices'. It was a ventriloquial gift that encompassed small children, every variety of male voice, aged women, and foreigners. The maximum number of voices Edwards produced for a single scene was six; in the course of a single episode he would often double it. <font size=\"-2\">Information for this series brief came from OTRCat.com, 'The Australian Dictionary of Biography Online', and Ian Grieve. </font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

You will find the series has a medical thread running through it and is in fact a highly compelling and sympathetic series of well-produced, medical-themed dramas. Within the stories, you get a great deal of medical history into the bargain. While the theme ties them all together, you will find these 13 productions stand on their own as good drama. They recall a period of amazing advances in common medical science, as well as recalling Medical Profession was a true vocation and the majority of its practitioners practiced their Hippocratic oath with integrity. Based on true stories and sponsored by Schenley Labs, Inc, who skimped on nothing with this brief series. The principal actors represent some of the finest talent of Stage and Screen, and the supporting Radio voice talent represent the era's finest radio actors. Leith Stevens provided a wonderful musical backdrop and William Lawrence's direction remains well-paced and timed. These charming dramas were based on medical research or the personal stories of medical workers. This series is one of the Golden Age of Radio's true, overlooked gems, both collectable and relevant to this day -- perhaps even moreso, given the current state of Health Care in the United States.

Groucho Marx Biography: Born: October 2, 1890 in New York City, New York Died: August 19, 1977 in Los Angeles, California Groucho was born Julius Henry Marx on October 2, 1890 in New York. He was the third of the five surviving sons of Sam and Minnie Marx. He was the first of the brothers to start stage career aged 15 in an act called <i>The Leroy Trio</i>. Other acts followed, but none of them was a great success. Twice the other members of the act disappeared overnight and left him penniless in a town far away from home. When his brothers came on stage, they finally had a success with the musical comedy called <i>I'll Say She Is</i>. It was at one of the performances of this show that Groucho got his painted moustache. He arrived late at the theater and used greasepaint to create a moustache. He found this so much easier than a glued on moustache that he insisted on using this technique from then on. <i>I'll Say She Is</i> was followed by two more Broadway hits -- <i>The Cocoanuts</i> and <i>Animal Crackers</i>. The latter of which has the character of Captain Spaulding which remained (with the song Hooray for Captain Spaulding) a trademark for Groucho for the rest of his life. The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers were also the first movies (except for one unreleased on) made by the Brothers and were filmed in New York. The remaining movies were made in Hollywood. In the later years of the Marx Brothers movie career, Groucho started working on radio. He hosted several programs and was a guest on many shows. His biggest success was the comedy quiz show <i>You Bet Your Life</i> which started in 1947. The show later moved to television and was on the air until 1961. Groucho also appeared in a few movies without his brothers. Always being a liberal, Groucho sometimes made critical remarks about politics and had friends which were regarded as communist by the US of the 1950s. This let to Groucho being investigated by the FBI. When Marx Brothers became popular again in the last sixties/early seventies Groucho made a comeback with a show in Carnegie Hall in 1972. At the film festival in Cannes in 1972, he was made Commandeur des Arts et Lettres and in 1974 he received a special Academy Award for the achievements of the Marx Brothers. Groucho died on August 19th, 1977 at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. His ashes are at Eden Memorial Park, San Fernando, California. From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Numerous magazines of \"True Crime Stories\" filled the newsstands. Radio also helped fill the need with fictional heroes such as <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Yours_Truly_Johnny_Dollar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnny Dollar</a> and <i>The Saint</i>. Few true crime dramas, other than <i>Gangbusters</i> or <i>Dragnet</i>, sustained long term success on radio. The Secrets of Scotland Yardwas a successful crime drama series, initially airing internationally between 1949 and 1951. Selected episodes finally came to a US radio network for a brief run much later in 1957 over the Mutual Broadcasting System. The series boasted well over 100 episodes, one of which, \"The Bone From A Voice Box\", apparently served as the prototype for another well remembered Towers Of London dramatic series, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Black_Museum\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Black Museum</a>. In both series, well known actors were employed as host / narrator, Orson Welles in <i>The Black Museum</i> and Clive Brook here. In fact, the shows were so similar that some of the same actual Scotland Yard cases were dramatized for both series (with totally different scripts, and casts). <i>The Secrets of Scotland Yard</i> was an independent production of the Towers of London syndicate in England for world wide distribution. Each week, an audience of anxious radio-listeners tuned in to hear these true crime stories of the London Metropolitan Police unfold, as the detectives at the Yard investigated some of England’s most famous criminals. Their trials have become legendary. Stories presented in the series include the theft of the British crown jewels by Colonel Thomas Blood; the story of a man who finds an armless and legless body wrapped in ribbons and lace; or the strange story of two close brothers who love one another enough to contemplate the murder of a brother’s affluent, yet unsightly and ignorant, wife. Murders, forgery, and robberies all get a through review on the program. Each time, Scotland Yard detectives are afoot to solve the crime mystery! <i>The Secrets of Scotland Yard</i> was initially hosted by Clive Brook, probably for the first year or so. To add to the air of authenticity, Brook sometimes discusses matters with Percy Hoskins, a 1950s crime expert and reporter for the London Daily Express. Hoskins knew every nook and cranny in London’s seedier districts and personally reported on many of the major crimes of the day. A student of crime, Hoskins was also one of the founders of the Saints and Sinners Club of London, an educational organization dedicated to true crime investigation methods and results. Brook had his own Scotland Yard experience previously when he played retired naval commander Stevenson in the 1936 film, \"Scotland Yard Commands\". American audiences will however probably more familiar with Brooks’ portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes in the 1932 film of the same name. Brook was eventually replaced by an actor portraying the character Superintendent X of Scotland Yard. From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

It was based on the popular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_film_series\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Dr. Kildare</i> movies</a> of the late 1930's and early 1940's, and brought to the microphone the stars of that series, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lew_Ayres\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lew Ayres</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Barrymore\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lionel Barrymore</a>. Ayres played the young, idealistic Dr. James Kildare; Barrymore, ever in character, was the crusty, loveable diagnostician, Dr. Leonard Gillespie. The men worked at Blair General Hospital, \"one of the great citadels of American medicine -- a clump of gray-white buildings planted deep in the heart of New York -- where life begins, where life ends, where life goes on.\" Kildare really believed that oath, and that's what this series was all about. His battle with hospital administration, stupid patients, and stupid parents made this the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Welby\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Marcus Welby</i></a> of the 1940's. The chief problem, both for Kildare and the listener, was that Blair Hospital was peopled by too many eccentrics. Gillespie, played to the limit by Barrymore, was enough for any show. But Dr. Carew, head of hospital administration, was a nut of the first order. Nurse Parker was a totally unbelievable old maid. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Osborne\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ted Osborne</a> did what he could with Carew, and Virginia Gragg's fine talent was hopelessly lost in the chattering role of Parker. In the end, Ayres and Barrymore saved this series, providing some solid stories, especially when they ventured into the real world and got away from the dummies at Blair. Writing and directing were done on a freelance basis; music was by <a href=\"http://www.spaceagepop.com/schumann.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Walter Schumann</a>. Actors contributing to Dr. Kildare included <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0365345/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stacy Harris</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Jewell\" rel=\"nofollow\">Isabel Jewell</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Novello\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jay Novello</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ellis\" rel=\"nofollow\">George Ellis</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Frees\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paul Frees</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Burr\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raymond Burr</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Webb\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Webb</a>.

The episodes are fifteen minutes long and serialized as well as having a domestic focus, tending to place the show in the soap opera genre. But the treatment of plot and character is light-hearted and humorous, similar to what is found in the myriad of sitcoms that sprang up during radio's golden age. Papa Bloom (Jake) has reached retirement age, and with some astute help from Mama (Becky) sells his kneepants factory at a nice profit. Together with their \"brood\" -- daughters Yetta and Sarah and sons-in-law Harold and Sidney -- they embark on an automobile trip to Hollywood to enjoy their first vacation in twenty-five years. The party has various adventures along the way. They stop at a resort hotel in Michigan, where Jake stuns even himself by proving to be a fantastically lucky bridge player. In the Arizona desert they are terrified by \"Indians\" (actually movie actors), but escape with scalps intact and soon reach their destination. There Jake, who Becky says is never happy unless he is worrying about something, invests in the motion picture business even though he knows nothing about it. Mama Becky Bloom is a delightful character, much like Molly in \"The Goldbergs,\" with which this series has been compared. She speaks with a heavy Yiddish accent and has trouble with both American English and history. In the desert, she tells Jake that they probably won't see any Indians because she's pretty sure that General Custer killed all of them! She also peppers her speech with fractured platitudes like \"you can't make a zebra change his spots\" and \"you shouldn't go to the well with the same bucket once too many times.\" The program was syndicated about 1934 by Broadcasters Program Syndicate/Bruce Eells and Associates.

This is the job of the guardian of the forest, Ranger Bill. Pouring rain, freezing cold, blistering heat, snows, floods, bears, rattlesnakes, mountain lions. Yes, all this in exchange for the satisfaction and pride of a job well done.\" That was the opening of Ranger Bill, a Christian radio adventure serial produced under the auspices of the Moody Broadcasting Network and the Moody Bible Institute. There were 206 episodes of Ranger Bill, which ran from 1950 to 1954 in a 15-minute format on WMBI in Chicago, and in syndication as a 30-minute show from 1954 to 1962. The series followed the adventures of Park Ranger Bill Jefferson. Miron Canaday starred as Bill, the chief forest ranger in the small Rocky Mountain town of Knotty Pine, where the former US Marine lived with his mother. Ranger Bill was your standard radio hero, a paragon of fitness and virtue who could resolve nearly any situation. Ranger Bill and his friends were faced with many situations to solve over the years, from the mundane, like finding lost kids or investigating the problems racing boats were causing on the lake, to the fantastic, including several elephant attacks, spacemen apparently coming from a meteor and trying to find a lost treasure in the Amazon, all the while stressing positive Christian values for young people. Friends that figured prominently in Bill's adventures included Stumpy Jenkins, an eagle-eyed ranger known for his marksmanship and often called \"the Old Timer\"; Henry Scott, Bill's teenage ward, was learning the ways of the woods by helping out Bill in the park, along with young ranger Ralph Carpenter; and Gray Wolf, a ranger and a member of the Dakota tribe. Gray Wolf spoke in the typical broken English for the era and genre, but knew how to use the traditional ways of his people and modern forest management methods to help Bill protect the woods. The first episode introduced Bill's boss, Colonel Anders, who sent Bill and Henry to blow up the Pine Ridge Dam in order to stop a forest fire threatening the Pendleton Valley. The program is still broadcast on the Children's Sonshine Network and on His Kids Radio, both on regional radio stations and internet simulcasts, along with several other similarly Christian-themed programs. <font size=\"-2\"></font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Ranger Bill <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>November 2, 2011 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>4 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

This was a radical departure in character for Mr. Powell from a Hollywood song and dance man to a hard-boiled detective. On June 11,1945, the <i>Lux Radio Theater</i> brought \"Murder My Sweet\" to radio, again with Dick Powell in the lead. These two performances prompted his selection for the part of Richard Rogue, in <i>Rogue’s Gallery</i> after his role for <i>Lux Radio Theater</i> and Richard Diamond came four years later. <i>Richard Diamond, Private Detective</i> came to NBC in 1949. Diamond was a slick, sophisticated detective, with a sharp tongue for folks who needed it. Diamond enjoyed the detective life, but not as much as entertaining his girl, Helen Asher. After each show, he would croon a number to his Park Avenue sweetheart. Mr. Powell, a former song and dance man, was perfect for the role. He added an extra dimension to the 40's hokey private eye drama. Diamond was a rough gumshoe that would often get knocked on the head with a revolver butt or other items. His counterpart on the police force was Lt. Levinson who often accepted Diamond's help reluctantly. Levinson would claim to get stomach trouble whenever Diamond would call him and would take bicarbonate to settle his aching stomach. Although they always seem at odds with each other, Diamond and Levinson were best friends. The plot theme remained fairly constant throughout the entire run of the show, Diamond getting beat up and solving a tough murder case with the support of the police department. Remarkably, for all the gun fights, Diamond never got shot. And for all his bravado, he had a serious case of vertigo. Helen Asher was portrayed by Virginia Gregg, who also played the part of Brooksie on <i>Let George Do It</i> and Betty Lewis on <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i>. Blake Edwards wrote the early shows and also directed a few. Music was composed by David Baskerville and later by Frank Wirth. In January of 1951, the series moved to ABC under the full sponsorship of Camel cigarettes. Then in May of 1953, the series moved to CBS but all shows were repeats from the 1950-51 Rexall sponsored season on NBC. Richard Diamond was one of the radio shows which successfully moved to television with David Janssen, later of <i>The Fugitive</i> fame, in the title role of Richard Diamond. The opening scene of the television show often featured the long lovely legs of Mary Tyler Moore, who went on to fame in <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show</i> and <i>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</i>. Mary was replaced on the <i>Richard Diamond</i> show when it became known that she owned the mystery legs. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NEW: Updated with Version 2 Files on 30-May-2007</font></b></i></p> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Titled <i>The Grantland Rice Story</i>, the 15-minute series comprised fifty-two sequential installments. First airing regionally as early as August 1955, the entire run soon appeared across the nation on various stations at varying times. Some aired it every weekday, some three days a week, some weekly. The program's 15-minute installments closely followed the text of Rice's book. Jimmy Powers, himself a noted sportswriter and announcer of 30 years, narrated, read and commented on Grantland Rice's story in the first person, as Rice had intended. Not quite the equivalent of today's audio-books, the material from \"The Tumult and The Shouting\" was augmented by contemporary asides and updates from Jimmy Powers. The series literally begins at chapter one of Rice's book and moves through the entire autobiography. Powers intersperses the selections from the book with other timely updates and observations about Rice not contained in the book. The additional material helps expand the legend of Rice himself, places his work in context with the era, and provides insights not previously available when the book was written some 11 years earlier. The entire syndicated series apparently aired in several overlapping markets. Tracking the broadcasts was particularly difficult given the 15 minute format. As best as we can establish, there was at least one contiguous run of the entire 52-installment series airing between September 1955 and September 1956. The series also aired in many markets at the 15-minute mark, often 'buried' behind an on-the-hour broadcast of another program. The series provides the most comprehensive insight into the career and experiences of one of the most important sportswriters in American history, during an era when the pen and typewriter was still as important to news media as the paper it was printed upon.

CBS decided to use New York City as the backdrop for this series and to focus on the happenings in an actual police precinct. The premise was to put the listener into the drama from the opening phone call until the final report was written. The 21st was described as <blockquote>\"just lines on a map of the city of New York. Most of the 173,000 people wedged into the nine-tenths of a square mile between Fifth Avenue and the East River wouldn't know if you asked them that they lived or worked in the 21st.\"</blockquote> The detail was made up of 160 patrolmen, eleven sergeants, and four lieutenants, under the command of one captain - Frank Kennelly. It was mentioned in each episode's closing that, \"<i>21st Precinct</i> is presented with the official cooperation of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association an organization of more than 20,000 members of the Police Department, City of New York.\" The Captain was the primary character and also acted as the narrator. Three actors played the Captain's role: Everett Sloane as Kennelly for the first 109 episodes and returned briefly in episode 135; James Gregory as Vincent Cronin for episode 109-144; and Les Damon as Thomas Keough starting in episode 145 through the remainder of the series. In supporting roles were Ken Lynch as Lt. Matt King and Harold Stone as Sgt. Waters. Santos Ortega appeared frequently as Lt. Patrick \"Red\" Gorman. Ninety-two episodes are in circulation for this series. It is generally believed that they were all recorded off the air by one collector as they were broadcast; however, many episodes appear to have been circulating independently of one another in the early 1970s.

Stewart was never better on the air than in this drama of Britt Ponset, frontier drifter created by Frank Burt. The epigraph set it up nicely: \"The man in the saddle is angular and long-legged: his skin is sun dyed brown. The gun in his holster is gray steel and rainbow mother-of-pearl. People call them both The Six Shooter.\" Ponset was a wanderer, an easy-going gentleman and -- when he had to be -- a gunfighter. Stewart was right in character as the slow-talking maverick who usually blundered into other people's troubles and sometimes shot his way out. His experiences were broad, but <i>The Six Shooter</i> leaned more to comedy than other shows of its kind. Ponset took time out to play <i>Hamlet</i> with a crude road company. He ran for mayor and sheriff of the same town at the same time. He became involved in a delighful Western version of <i>Cinderella</i>, complete with grouchy stepmother, ugly sisters, and a shoe that didn't fit. And at Christmas he told a young runaway the story of <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, Substituting the original Dickens characters with Western heavies. Britt even had time to fall in love, but it was the age-old story of people from different worlds, and the romance was foredoomed despite their valiant efforts to save it. So we got a cowboy-into-the-sunset ending for this series, truly one of the bright spots of radio. Unfortunately, it came too late, and lasted only one season. It was a transcribed show, sustained by NBC and directed by Jack Johnstone. Basil Adlam provided the music and Frank Burt wrote the scripts.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">CHALLENGE OF THE YUKON</font></b></u></i></p> <i>Challenge of the Yukon</i> was a long-running radio series that began on Detroit's station WXYZ (as had <i>The Lone Ranger</i> and <i>The Green Hornet</i>), and an example of a Northern genre story. The series was first heard on February 3, 1938. The program was an adventure series about Sergeant William Preston of the Northwest Mounted Police and his lead sled dog, Yukon King, as they fought evildoers in the Northern wilderness during the Gold Rush of the 1890s. Preston, according to radio historian Jim Harmon, first joined the Mounties to capture his father's killer, and when he was successful he was promoted to Sergeant. Preston worked under the command of Inspector Conrad, and in the early years was often assisted by a French-Canadian guide named Pierre. Preston's staunchest ally, who was arguably the true star of the show and indeed often did more work than he did, was the brave Alaskan husky, Yukon King. Typical plots involved the pair helping injured trappers, tracking down smugglers, or saving cabin dwellers from wolverines. Sgt. Preston's faithful steed was Rex, used primarily in the summer months, but generally Yukon King and his dog team were the key mode of transportation (as signalled by Preston's cry of \"On, King! On, you huskies!.\" There is some confusion regarding King's actual breed. The producers seemed to use malamute and husky interchangeably. At least once, Preston answered \"malamute\" to the question from another character. In the early radio shows, the cry of \"On, you huskies!\" would alternate with \"On, you malamutes\" from show to show. Von Reznicek's Donna Diana Overture was the pulsing theme music, and the episodes ended with the official pronouncement, Well, King, this case is closed. Following the success of <i>The Lone Ranger</i> and <i>The Green Hornet</i>, George W. Trendle, the station owner, asked for a similar adventure show, but with a dog as the hero. According to WXYZ staffer Dick Osgood, in his history of the station, Trendle insisted that it not be \"a dog like Lassie because.. this must be an action story. It had to be a working dog.\" Writer Tom Dougall, who had been influenced by the poems of Robert W. Service, naturally chose a Husky. The dog was originally called Mogo, but after criticism by Trendle, Dougall re-christened the canine King. Dougall likewise created Sgt. Preston and the French-Canadian guide. Fran Striker, who wrote for <i>The Lone Ranger</i>, also contributed scripts. However, Trendle's criticism of Dougall may have had another reason behind it. Shortly before the two Trendle series aired (<i> The Lone Ranger</i> and <i>Challenge of the Yukon</i>), popular author Zane Grey had a book in circulation (Lone Star Ranger) about a Texas Ranger like <i>The Lone Ranger</i> and a comic book series in circulation (King of the Royal Mounted) about the adventures of Sgt. King, a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman like Sgt. Preston. It could be that Trendle borrowed both ideas from Grey's work and wanted to retain the name \"King\" as a tribute to Grey, who died after a long illness one year following the first airing of <i>Challenge of the Yukon</i>. <i>Challenge of the Yukon</i> began as a 15-minute serial, airing locally from 1938 until May 28, 1947. Shortly thereafter, the program acquired a sponsor, Quaker Oats, and the series, in a half-hour format, moved to the networks. The program aired on ABC from June 12, 1947 to December 30, 1949. It was then heard on The Mutual Broadcasting System from January 2, 1950 through the final broadcast on June 9, 1955. The title changed from <i>Challenge of the Yukon</i> to Sergeant Preston of the Yukon in November 1951, and remained under that name through the end of the series and into television. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">ADVENTURES OF PHILIP MARLOWE</font></b></u></i></p> Elements of mystery have always been represented in literature, but the detective story didn't arrive on the scene until the mid 1800's. Edgar Allan Poe's The Murders in the Rue Morgue, published in 1841, was the first. The Murder's main character, C. Auguste Dupin, was a brilliant detective who relied on superior deductive powers to solve the crime. He and his unnamed narrator companion solved this and two other mysteries. Later in the 19th century Sir Arthur Conan Doyle expanded on Poe's new concept in his Sherlock Holmes stories. Many think that Doyle patterned Holmes and Watson after Dupin and his friend. The Sherlock Holmes stories were wildly popular in England, and after Conan Doyle, the British continued to dominate the detective genre with other detectives who depended on keen observation and deductive logic to solve crimes. These detectives most commonly applied their brilliance to crimes in quaint country houses outside small idyllic villages. Then, in the 1930's and 1940's American writers added a grittier urban element to the detective genre -- the hardboiled detective. As opposed to the typical British detective, the hardboiled detective was generally a cynical loner with a strong sense of justice that wasn't necessarily limited to that provided by the court system. Instead of country houses, these detectives were more likely to be found in shady all-night bars or on the mean streets of Los Angeles, Chicago, or New York City. Dashiell Hammett introduced the new genre, and Sam Spade, in 1930 in his novel The Maltese Falcon. A few years later Raymond Chandler came along and perfected the type, with his detective, Philip Marlowe. Chandler introduced Marlowe in his first novel, The Big Sleep, and Philip Marlowe continued to solve crimes in six subsequent Chandler novels. Chandler had previously published a number of short stories featuring other detectives; however, Marlowe proved so popular that when the stories were later republished the author often switched the detectives to Philip Marlowe. Chandler's style was unique. His sparse style was full of wonderfully sharp similies and rich descriptive narration. Here's an example from The Little Sister: <blockquote> \"I put the duster away folded with the dust in it, leaned back and just sat, not smoking, not even thinking. I was a blank man. I had no face, no meaning, no personality, hardly a name. I didn't want to eat. I didn't even want a drink. I was the page from yesterday's calendar crumpled at the bottom of the waste basket.\" </blockquote> And another from The High Window: <blockquote> \"Then he picked the glass up and tasted it and sighed again and shook his head sideways with a half smile; the way a man does when you give him a drink and he needs it very badly and it is just right and the first swallow is like a peek into a cleaner, sunnier, brighter world.\" </blockquote> Marlowe was a more complex character than some of his hard boiled brethren. Sure he could handle a gun and take a beating. But, he was more than just a tough guy, he had gone to college, could play chess, and appreciated classical music. He also had his own strong ethical standards and turned down jobs that didn't measure up to those standards. By the late 1940's Marlowe had moved to the big screen, with Marlowe played by Dick Powell, Robert Mitchum, and Humphrey Bogart. One of those movies, Murder My Sweet, was responsible for Marlowe's first appearance on radio when it was presented on <i>Lux Radio Theatre</i> on June 11, 1945 starring Dick Powell and Clair Trevor. In April, 1947 the New York Times announced that the summer replacement for Bob Hope would be a new adventure-mystery series, <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i>. Airing on NBC at 10:00 p.m. on June 17th, the show starred Van Heflin with a script by Milton Geiger based on the stories of Raymond Chandler. Most radio shows had live audiences in the studio. The Philip Marlowe producers decided against the common practice because they thought audiences might detract from the show. However 19 of Los Angeles' top detectives were in the studio during the airing of the first show. No one knows what the detectives thought of the production, but according to the New York Times review, Van Heflin did well but struggled with an awkward script. The reviewer thought the show depended too much on straight narration at dramatic moments instead of action or dialog. \"Leaving ones play in the wings, as they say on Broadway, always makes for disconcerting theatre, and this was painfully true in the case of <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i>.\" Raymond Chandler wasn't enthralled by the show either. In a letter to Earl Stanley Gardner, author of the Perry Mason novels, Mr. Chandler said \"It was thoroughly flat.\" This initial run of <i>Philip Marlowe</i> went from June 17 to September 19, 1947, with Pepsodent as the sponsor. The announcer was Wendell Niles, music was by Lyn Murray, and the producer was Jim Fonda. After the summer run ended, NBC dropped the show. As far as we know, only four episodes of this series have survived. The character of Philip Marlowe was too good to stay off stage for long though. A year later CBS decided to take a chance on reviving the show. Norman Macdonnell was producer/director; Gene Levitt, Robert Mitchell, Mel Dinelli, and Kathleen Hite wrote the scripts; and Richard Aurandt was responsible for the music. CBS cast Gerald Mohr to star as Philip Marlowe, with Roy Rowan as announcer. Philip Marlowe, being a loner, was really the only regular character, but throughout the three years the series ran a long string of high-quality supporting Hollywood actors appeared on the show. Performing alongside Mohr at various times were Jeff Corey, Howard McNear, Parley Baer, Lawrence Dobkin, Virginia Gregg, Gloria Blondell, and Lou Krugman. The CBS production ran from September 26, 1948 to September 29, 1950 with an additional short summer run from July 7 to September 15, 1951. This revival of <i>Philip Marlowe</i> was more favorably received, probably because of a combination of writing and acting. No one could duplicate the writing of Raymond Chandler, but this group of writers was very good. While Chandler's distinctive similes were largely lacking, the strong dry, sarcastic narration was there, and the way Gerald Mohr delivered the lines had a way of making you forget that they weren't written by Chandler. Mr. Mohr seemed born for the part of the cynical detective. His voice and timing were perfect for the character. In a letter to Gene Levitt, one of the show's writers, Raymond Chandler commented that a voice like Gerald Mohr's at least packed personality; a decided an improvement over his opinion of the original show. By 1949 the show had the largest audience in radio. CBS capitalized on the popularity of <i>Philip Marlowe</i> to introduce a look-alike show a few months later, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Yours_Truly_Johnny_Dollar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</a>. During the period both shows were broadcast, Johnny Dollar played second fiddle to the popular Philip Marlowe. Even after Marlowe went off the air in 1951, Dollar remained an average detective show. That was to end Oct 3, 1955 when <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Yours_Truly_Johnny_Dollar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</a> changed everything; the writers, the format to 15 minutes and the lead actor. The new 15 minute episodes staring Bob Bailey dominated detective/mystery drama from then until its last broadcast, September 30, 1962. That date and that broadcast are generally considered as the last of the radio drama broadcasts. <i>Philip Marlowe</i> continued to find limited success in the movies and television in America and England after his radio career ended. Several quality presentations of Chandler's character were produced by the BBC in the 1990's. But the death of Chandler's wife pulled him into severe depression and put an end any effective writing. His last unfinished book, Poodle Springs, was finished by Robert B. Parker, a good friend who tried to remain faithful to the Chandler style. Unfortunately, the critics did not agree. Philip Marlowe, the gritty, no nonsense American detective lived and vanished from the quill of a writer raised in Europe. He will remain a classic buried in the modern world of fighting crime with technology. From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">WORLD ADVENTURER'S CLUB</font></b></u></i></p> The year is 1932, and the nation is still suffering from the effects of the Great Depression, recovery is in sight, fueled by industry success as much as government programs. The listeners of <i>The World Adventerer’s Club</i> and other travelogue series in this early part of radio’s Golden Age were offered glimpses of exotic places and extraordinary events without leaving their own front room. The renewed interest in far off lands and cultures was, at least in part, also a reflection of the political situation. Many nations during this time were expanding their influence around the globe establishing colonies and outposts. You can still hear a faint echo of this influence in the stories -- some of the episodes carry a decidedly “colonial” attitude toward the native inhabitants of these countries … who are sometimes characterized in a manner that, by today’s standards, would be offensive. The setting for the series is a well-to-do gentleman’s club of the type that flourished in the 1890’s from Europe to the US. There’s even an all male chorus on hand, common to those establishments, which each week extols the virtues of living on the edge where adventures, discoveries, and the real threat of death are constant companions Using the cigar-smoky, brandy in hand, parlor as a backdrop, each episode takes the form of a report being told to the other members of the club by someone who’s just returned from some adventure in a far away, mysterious place. Members in the radio audience need only sit back in their chair, close their eyes, and imagine that they, too, are basking in the camaraderie of the club – as they share their experiences. Sadly, nothing is known about any of the regular cast members of this show. We do know that Hanley Stafford was the featured story teller in at least six of the episodes. Hanley Stafford, who was born on September 22, 1889 as Alfred John Austin, took his stage name from his birthplace of Hanley, Staffordshire in England. No stranger to US radio his was the voice of “Daddy” for “Baby Snooks” and “Dithers” in the “Blondie” radio program. He died of a heart attack just a couple weeks before his 79th birthday on September 11 1968. The series was transcribed by a California company named Transco. Of course, one of the benefits of transcription is that all 32 of the 15-minute episodes produced are still available for us to enjoy today. A tribute to the enduring nature of this series, it should be mentioned that much later, from January 1947 to January 1948, another series borrowed it’s format for a set of 30-minute episodes under the simplified name <i>The Adventurer’s Club</i>. And now, find a deep wingback chair, lean back, and prepare to enter a time when most of the world was truly unknown and any exploration revealed wonders, opportunities and dangers.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">SHELL CHATEAU</font></b></u></i></p> <i>Shell Chateau</i> was a musical variety series that began on June 29, 1935, with Al Jolson serving as its host. Some sources even mention that the program was developed around Jolson and his talents. However, Jolson left the series briefly in the fall of 1935 due to a movie commitment. Wallace Beery, one of the country’s most popular film stars of the period took over the host position following a one week stint by radio newsman, Walter Winchell. Jolson returned in January of 1936, but didn’t hang around for long and departed permanently in April 1936. Based on a recommendation by the program’s music director, Victor Young, Smith Ballew was installed as the new host and remained with the program for the remainder of 1936. Smith Ballew had previously worked extensively on records with Victor Young; they had been friends since 1926. The <i>Shell Chateau</i> program appears to be one of Ballew’s last gig’s as a big band musican and he started carving out a name for himself as an actor, when Sol Lesser invited Ballew to do a series of 'B' Westerns for Twentieth Century Fox as a singing cowboy. In 1937, the program was reorganized around the Legendary Broadway comic Joe Cook. The essential format remained the same until the series ended in June 1937. It’s unfortunate that this certified series is missing the episodes featuring Walter Winchell and Joe Cook, perhaps one day representative episodes will became available. And now a few brief comments about the series and Al Jolson: Al Jolson was known in the industry as \"The World's Greatest Entertainer,\" for well over 40 years. During that time such performers as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, and many others spoke of Jolson in this way. After his death his influence continued unabated with such performers as Elvis Presley, Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Jackie Wilson and Jerry Lee Lewis, all mentioning Jolson as an inspiration. Jolson on radio faired better, at the time of the <i>Shell Chateau</i> broadcasts, than in the movies. Though Jolson ushered in the sound era in movies with the landmark 1926 film, “Jazz Singer” for Warner Brothers. Critics generally viewed his screen appearances as a pale ghost of the stage Jolson. On film, with a few exceptions, Jolson come across as stiff and wooden. He continued into the 1930s making but was most popular on radio. This situation continued until the mid 40s when Columbia Pictures, inspired by the success of its film \"Yankee Doodle Dandy,\" decided a Jolson biography might work as well. So in 1946 Columbia rolled out TheJolson Story, starring Larry Parks miming to Jolson's vocals. It was the surprise smash hit of the season, and the highest grossing film of the year. Parks received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor. Because of the film, Jolson was now as big, or bigger, than ever. Al Jolson had a life-long devotion to entertaining American troops, servicemen and women, and against the advice of his doctors, agreed to entertain the troops in Korea in 1950 it was during this overseas tour that his heart began to fail. He died on October 23, 1950, in San Francisco, California at the age of 64, evidently of a heart attack, and was interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. On the day he died, the bright lights of Broadway were turned off for 10 minutes in his honor. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Shell Chateau <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>May 20, 2006 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Ladd, long an admirer of 'The Brighter Side', Damon Runyon's long-running newspaper column, initially signed Pat O'Brien to star as 'Broadway' in the program. Indeed we have an alleged audition from the program, titled \"Princess O'Hara\" in which O'Brien and Wendy Barrie are heard announcing the next production of the series, 'A Piece of Pie'. Newspaper listings of the era describe Pat O'Brien slated to cut all 52 programs upon completing principal filming of the Howard Hughes/RKO feature, <i>The Boy with Green Hair</i>. But the quixotic Hughes decided the 'message' element of <i>The Boy with Green Hair</i> was a bit too risky for late-1940s audiences. He directed that the film be re-shot, as needed, to remove the social intolerance message from the completed celluloid.<br /><br />Newspaper accounts cite O'Brien as anticipating a New York recording session for all 52 episodes of <i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i> sometime during the Summer of 1948. But owing to the re-shoot and re-cutting of <i>The Boy with Green Hair</i>, the movie wasn't completed until September of 1948. This may--or may not--explain Pat O'Brien's absence from the remaining episodes of <i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i>--or whether any were recorded beyond Princess O'Hara. Given the common practice of cutting two to five transcribed recordings in one session, one might well imagine that O'Brien recorded as many as five Damon Runyon Theatre programs before his performances were cut short. But it's intriguing to wonder how many of the episodes they actually did record before O'Brien had to rush back to RKO's West Coast studios to complete <i>The Boy with Green Hair</i>.<br /><br />As it turns out, Ladd tapped short-lived veteran Radio actor John Brown to voice the recurring 'Broadway' character so central to the exposition of every episode of <i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i>. As most fans of the program would attest, John Brown's 'Broadway' was as good as it gets in Radio. Brown had already begun performing a similar character on <i>My Friend Irma</i> (1947) as Irma's (Marie Wilson) shiftless boyfriend, so the leap to yet another Lower East Side accent wasn't that great for Brown. Indeed, one wonders if Brown ever got out of character for the seven years that <i>My Friend Irma</i> aired over CBS.<br /><br />Yet another stumbling block for many new programs produced in 1948 was the infamous 'Petrillo Ban' on producing any new professional Radio recordings. The following is from the <i>Time Magazine</i> article of December 29, 1947:<br /><br /><blockquote>\"Cocky little James Caesar Petrillo just sat back and waited. Recording companies rushed symphony orchestras, hillbilly bands and blues singers in & out of studios, trying to record as much as possible by January 1, when Petrillo's ban on record-making becomes effective. Record officials gloated that they had piled up a big enough backlog of new records to last a year or more. They were hopeful that Petrillo's Musicians' Union might not be able to stand so long a layoff.<br /><br />Last week, James Petrillo pointed his stubby finger at a point they had apparently overlooked. The Taft-Hartley law prevented record companies from signing a new contract which would pay royalties to a union-administered fund—but the record companies had obligingly recorded a year's supply under the old contract. All those phonograph records to be doled out over the bleak months ahead, he thought, would net his union around $10,000,000.<br /><br />The record companies looked as if they had been hit over the head with a kettledrum. Together with men from radio, television, and phonograph manufacturers, they formed a united industry committee to fight Petrillo. But Petrillo wasn't budging an inch: \"We are never going to make records again—ever. That's one New Year's resolution we've made and one we are going to keep.\"</blockquote><br /><br />James Caesar Petrillo was president of the American Federation of Musicians, who had successfully imposed a ban on professional recordings between 1942 and 1944 until an appropriate royalty system could be established to the benefit of his union members. Petrillo successfully reimposed the ban for most of 1948--it was finally lifted on November 22, 1948. Indeed, then Freshman Congressman Richard M. Nixon made headlines taking up the cudgel for the Recording Industry in an attempt to thwart Petrillo's union.<br /><br />This is the reason the same music theme is employed in both the alleged Pat O'Brien audition recordings and the final production pressings of <i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i>. Having dodged two potential stumbling blocks, Ladd's <i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i> was first aired over independent radio station KSEL, Lubbock, Texas.<br /><br />The program was soon heard over most major outlets between November 1948 and December 1951. As with Mayfair's other syndicated programs, the production quality and engineering is superb. Veteran Mayfair producer Vern Carstensen again supervises the production and Richard Sanville directs. Mayfair writer Russell Hughes adapts Damon Runyon's wonderful short stories, maintaining the very Runyonesque flavor of both the dialogue and settings.<br /><br />But what is it that makes a character or storyline Runyonesque? For three generations of Americans, a Damon Runyon character evoked a social archetype from the Brooklyn or Midtown demi-monde elements of New York society. Think of it as the Bizarro World version of New York's 'The 400'. Runyon spun fascinating, tongue-incheek tales of gamblers, hustlers, actors, and gangsters--and their dolls. Most self-respecting denizens of Runyon's fanciful world preferred colorful monikers such as 'Nathan Detroit,' 'Big Jule,' 'Harry the Horse Thief,' 'Good Time Charlie,' 'Dave the Dude,' or 'The Seldom Seen Kid.'<br /><br />Runyon spun his tales in a uniquely vernacular style that mixed overly formal speech with richly colored slang. This idiomatic language was invariably spoken in the present tense, quite deliberately devoid of any contractions. Runyon is credited as the first major American writer to \"stylize both the language and the behavior of gangsters and depict them as another part of the socio-economic system, showing how the underworld provided clients with gambling, sex and hard-to-get sports tickets and, during Prohibition, with liquor,\" according to Cornell University English Professor, Daniel Schwarz.<br /><br />Runyon's flamboyant street characters, with their aggressive one-line retorts, have shaped the world's image of 20th Century New York City for over eighty years. That's the charm and flavor that makes each of these recordings so timeless. Those familiar with Runyon's work will remember that the famous Frank Sinatra/Marlon Brando vehicle <i>Guys and Dolls</i> (1955) was based on Damon Runyon's unique vision of New York City and its inhabitants--and the long-running play of the same name. Indeed, had <i>Guys and Dolls</i> been filmed six years earlier, one might well imagine that <i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i> may have been named <i>Guys and Dolls</i>.<br /><br />The Mayfair rendition of Damon Runyon's fascinating world remains as true to form and substance as both the 1200-performance <i>Guys and Dolls</i> stage play and the Oscar-nominated <i>Guys and Dolls</i> film. Runyon's most celebrated short stories were spun into a 52-week long, seamless atmosphere of a New York City that shaped popular perceptions of The Big Apple throughout the remainder of the Golden Age of Radio and the Golden Age of Television as well. Veteran dialecticians Gerald Mohr, Herb Vigran, Sheldon Leonard, Luis Van Rooten, Alan Reed and Lionel Stander gave every program of the run an authenticity and indelible flavor that were imitated in both Radio and Television for decades to come.<br /><br /><i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i> stands as one of Mayfair's finest contributions to The Golden Age of Radio and remains a valuable addition to any Golden Age Radio collector's library. As an artifact of American Society it represents an invaluable time capsule of period vernacular. But most of all it stands as an enduring reminder of the genius of Damon Runyon's insight into the class warfare that evolved during and after the Roaring 20s and The Great Depression.<br /><br /><br /><br /><font size=\"-2\">From <a href=\"http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Damon-Runyon-Theatre.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Digital Deli Too</a>.</font><br /><br /><hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b><br /><br /><b>Series Name: </b>The Damon Runyon Theatre<br /><b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete<br /><b>Certification Date: </b>March 28, 2013<br /><b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1<br /><b>Number of CDs: </b>2<br /><br /><br />From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.  See \"Note\" Section below for more information on the OTRR.<br /></blockquote>",

The character made his first appearance in August of 1939 in the comic book Mystery Men #1, published by Fox Features Syndicate. <i>The Blue Beetle</i> radio serial aired from 05-15-40 to 09-13-40 as a CBS 30 minutes, syndicated series.

With the help of his friend and mentor, pharmacist and drug-store proprietor Dr. Franz, Dan acquired a costume of bullet-proof chain-mail-like cellulose material, and began a second life, fighting crime as The Blue Beetle. His calling card was a small beetle-shaped marker that he left in conspicuous places to alert criminals to his presence, using their fear of his crime fighting reputation as a weapon against them. For this purpose he also used a \"Beetle Signal\" flashlight. The Blue Beetle's reputation was not his only weapon -- he carried a revolver in a blue holster on his belt, and was sometimes shown wearing a multi-pouched belt after the style set by Batman. Also in the Batman vein, the Blue Beetle had a \"BeetleMobile\" car and a \"BeetleBird\" airplane. In at least one radio adventure, he carries something called a \"magic ray machine\".

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">ADVENTURE AHEAD!</font></b></u></i></p> <i>Adventure Ahead!</i> was a brilliant Summer feature for 1944. Comprised of fourteen stirring adventure novels and stories from among America's greatest fiction writers, its somewhat more masculine orientation may have kept some of the young females of the era listening to Frank Sinatra that summer instead of <i>Adventure Ahead!</i>. But it was indeed billed as 'famous stories for young people', not 'famous stories for young men'. And yet, how any rational programmer at NBC-Red could have construed the slant of this project to young people is anyone's guess. There's no discernible love interest, there are female protagonists, nor any female authorities or mentors for that matter. Of course this was the 1940s after all, still in the throes of the fight for equality on many fronts. It's just quite obvious that NBC-Red programmers were simply completely out of touch with their era. That having been said, each of these literary choices did have a uniting theme--defending Freedom, domestically and abroad. To be fair to NBC's programmers, there were several jingoistic, over the top, almost fascist 'public service programs' geared toward every facet of domestic population at one time or another during the World War II years and the Cold War Years that followed. So overlooking the slant for the time being, let's focus in on the selected stories and their themes. Virtually all of these stories were male-oriented, 'coming of age' tales of one type or another. Dana's <i>Two Years Before the Mast</i> was one of the books virtually any father would expect his son to have read by the time he was eleven. A stirring tale of independent thinking, the courage to act on it, and the satisfaction of correctly asserting one's convictions is always a satisfying read for boy and man alike. For young ladies, even during the 1940s, not so much. All it would have conjured up was more of the status quo the Rosie the Riveters and their daughters across America were fighting against, sweating to defeat, and earning the right to overturn. Sadly this same theme can be set forth in the other twelve selections as well. Suspending belief a bit further, <i>The Arrival of The Lily Bean</i>, ostensibly the one female oriented theme in the entire run, stems from Walter Dumaux Edmond's compilation of short stories that appeared over several installments in <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> and <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> entitled simply, <i>Young Ames</i>. The fact that this is one of the two exemplars of the series not in circulation doesn't help. But from what I can recall from the Saturday Evening Post installment of the same name, <i>The Arrival of the Lily Bean</i> was yet another male coming of age story as well--but in the romantic arena. T.B. Aldrich's <i>The Story of A Bad Boy</i>--as adapted--was a greatly abridged version of the original novel, which basically traced the entire life of the author at various critical 'coming of age' junctures throughout his life. What survives in the <i>Adventure Ahead!</i> installment is a series of vignettes of the 'bad behaviour' of the protagonist. The 'bad behaviours' are a series inspired pranks which, in the final analysis were instigated with the best of intentions. It's just that most of them backfired in one way or the other. <i>Inside The FBI</i> is a stirring tale of the inner workings of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Clearly fascinating fodder for the imagination of any young male. Reportedly blessed by J.Edgar Hoover himself, it doesn't take much thought to imagine how the piece is slanted. With most of the emphasis on FBI scientific procedure and analysis, there's plenty here to fire the imagination of any young man. <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is a classic of American literature. Even abridged, it's easy to understand how naturally this selection sprang to mind when developing the project. Daniel Defoe's classic exists here in skeleton form only, but it's a good listen to this day. And if it prompts you to reach for your own copy from the library shelf, so much the better. It's an amazing read--and re-read. <i>A Tooth for Paul Revere</i> is one of Stephen Vincent BenÃ©t's most enduring short stories. It's been adapted and readapted in hundreds of productions over Radio, Animation, Television, and Film. If you've never read it yourself, then don't miss the opportunity to listen to the <i>Adventure Ahead!</i> rendition. It captures all of the key elements of BenÃ©t's original story. <i>Toby Tyler</i> . . . is pure young male adventure fantasy, both delightfully spun and poignantly punctuated. One of the more realistically and sensitively portrayed productions, we found it one of the more enjoyable of the existing eleven exemplars. Waldo Fleming's <i>Talking Drums</i> is pure male juvenile escapism very much in the Jungle Jim or Tarzan mold, but with a bit more cerebral moral dilemmas interwoven into the script. One of the better recorded examples from this run, the foley work is wonderfully evocative and contributes to the many turns in the script. <i>The Biscuit Eater</i> by James Street is a wonderfully charming story of a boy and his dog, a useless 'biscuit eater' of a pup, saved from the drowning well by the boy who fell in love with the pup at first sight. It's one of the more enjoyable and inspirational programs of the thirteen. A wonderful little morality play, the touching interaction between a boy, his faith in his dog, and his love for his own father resolves itself in a wonderfully satisfying manner. Mabel Leigh Hunt's <i>Have You Seen Tom Thumb</i> is one of the two missing episodes from this production. It's still very easy to see why it was included in this anthology. The original story the fictionalized account of the famous dwarf, Charles Sherwood Stratton, who, as General Tom Thumb became a living legend in the Circus world, and eventually made a wonderful life for himself and his family in the process. From performing for the crowned heads of Europe saving P.T. Barnum from bankruptcy to meeting President Abraham Lincoln himself, Tom Thumb's life story is both a fascinating adventure and a tale of great inspiration to any young person with a physical limitation of any kind. Hubert Skidmore's <i>Hill Lawyer</i> is a wonderful adventure in small town human relations and interaction. Both inspirational and well-grounded in basic American decency, there's no question that this program left an impression on its young listeners--and perhaps a few of it's older listeners as well. G.A Henty's <i>One of the 28th</i> and <i>Greenmantle</i>, the wonderful espionage story by John Buchan round out the last two installments of this adventure series. Very similar in their militaristic slant, they're both wonderful period adventures in their own right. The former, a rousing vignette of the Battle of Waterloo, is perhaps the one exemplar in circulation that provides a heroine as a protagonist. <i>Greenmantle</i>, by contrast, is a riveting tale of spycraft and espionage at the turn of the century. Espionage adventures almost always build far more anxiety and anticipation in the course of the script and this one is no exception. The series closed prematurely with Alexander Dumas' stirring <i>The Three Musketeers</i>, the classic adventure story of four loyalist Musketeers, D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis who take a mission to England to retrieve a wooden box full of diamonds and eventually take down Cardinal Richelieu. Their motto, \"one for all, all for one\" becomes a popular rallying cry of enduring friendship and loyality for millions of youngsters throughout the world for two centuries. The series was overtaken by events with the NBC-Red-wide broadcast of the Sixth War Loan Drive on November 11, 1944, effectively ending the series. The better encodes of this remarkable Summer series are wonderful reminders of the type of inspirational fare of the 1940s during a world at War. Not preachy, not particularly jingoistic, but clearly selected and adapted to act as both a comfort and inspiration to the thousands of young people anxiously awaiting resolution of the War and the return of their brothers, fathers and uncles. In this respect alone, this gem of a short series is a definite keeper from The Golden Age of Radio. <font size=\"-2\">Information from <a href=\"http://www.digitaldeliftp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Digital Deli Online</a>.</font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Adventure Ahead <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>December 10, 2012 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

Johnny was an accomplished 'padder' of his expense account. The name of the show derives from the fact that he closed each show by totaling his expense account, and signing it \"End of report... Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\". Terry Salomonson in his authoritative \"A Radio Broadcast Log of the Drama Program Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", notes that the original working title was \"Yours Truly, Lloyd London\". Salomonson writes \"Lloyd London was scratched out of the body of (the Dick Powell) audition script and Johnny Dollar was written in. Thus the show was re-titled on this script and the main character was renamed. Why this was done was unclear â possibly to prevent a legal run-in with Lloydâs of London Insurance Company.\" Although based in Hartford, Connecticut, the insurance capital of the world, freelancer Johnny Dollar managed to get around quite a bit â his adventures taking him all over the world. There were some unusual devices used in the show that help set it apart from other shows. There was no partner, assistant, or secretary for Johnny. The character closest to a continuing role was that of Pat McCracken of the Universal Adjustment Bureau, who assigned Johnny many of his cases. Another atypical aspect gave the show additional credibility â frequently, characters on the show would mention that they had heard about Johnnyâs cases on the radio. Johnny often used his time when filling out his expense accounts to give the audience background information or to express his thoughts about the current case. No fewer than eight actors played Johnny Dollar. Dick Powell, of <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Rogues_Gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogueâs Gallery</a> fame, cut the original audition tape, but chose to do <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Richard_Diamond_Private_Detective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Diamond, Private Detective</a> instead. Gerald Mohr, of <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i> fame, auditioned in 1955, prior to Bob Bailey getting the title role. Through the first three actors to play Johnny Dollar (Charles Russell, Edmond O'Brien, and John Lund), there was little to distinguish the series from many other radio detective series. Dollar was just another hard-boiled detective in a medium that was overloaded with the stereotype. Charles Russell, the first to play the role, would throw silver dollars to bellboys and waiters. Luckily, this trite gimmick did not survive long. On October 3, 1955, after a hiatus of over a year, the show came back with a vengeance. A new production team, including director/writer Jack Johnstone, a new star, Bob Bailey, from the radio series <i>Let George Do It</i>, and a new format would set the series apart from its competitors. Johnny's cases were now a continuing serial, five days a week, for fifteen minutes each evening. With 75 minutes of airtime, minus commercials and openings and closings, there was sufficient time to develop good storylines and interesting characters. During this time, <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> attracted some of the best writers in Hollywood, including Jack Johnstone, E. Jack Neuman (using the pen name John Dawson), Robert Ryf, and Les Crutchfield. Bob Bailey also wrote a script while he was playing Johnny Dollar. He used the pen name Robert Bainter (Bainter was his middle name) as the scriptwriter for \"The Carmen Kringle Matter\", which was aired on Saturday, December 21, 1957 on the West Coast, and on the following day for the rest of the country. Bob Bailey, generally thought of as the most popular of the Johnny Dollars, brought a new interpretation to the character â tough, but not hard-boiled; streetwise, but not overly cynical, Bailey's Dollar was smart and gritty when he had to be. But Bailey's Johnny Dollar was also human. His character would get emotionally involved in a number of his cases. He had a streak of impatience, and would occasionally not fully listen to a witness and rush off on a tangent before realizing his mistake. The weekday serialized episodes are generally acknowledged as some of the finest radio detective shows ever produced. There were fifty six multi-part shows in all: fifty four five-part shows, one six-part show, and one nine-part show. The serialized episodes continued until November 2, 1956 when the series again reverted to a once a week, thirty minute format. Bob Bailey continued in the lead, until \"The Empty Threat Matter\" of November 27, 1960, when the Hollywood run ended. The guest stars and supporting casts were always first rate, attracting the best radio actors in both Los Angeles and New York. Pat McCracken was played by several actors â most frequently, by Larry Dobkin. Particularly noteworthy was the work of Virginia Gregg, who played many roles, including Johnny's girlfriend Betty Lewis. Harry Bartell was also a frequent guest, who did many of the Spanish dialect roles when Johnny went to a Latin American country. Other frequent guest performers were Parley Baer, Tony Barrett, John Dehner, Don Diamond, Sam Edwards, Herb Ellis, Frank Gerstle, Stacy Harris, Jack Kruschen, Forrest Lewis, Howard McNear, Marvin Miller, Jeanette Nolan, Vic Perrin, Barney Phillips, Jean Tatum, Russell Thomson, Ben Wright, and Will Wright. Vincent Price co-starred as himself in \"The Price of Fame Matter\" and went to Europe with Johnny on the case. In December 1960, the show moved to New York. Robert Readick started the New York run as Dollar, but only lasted a short while. Jack Johnstone continued to write for the show and submitted scripts from California. Johnstone wrote about 350 Johnny Dollar scripts under his own name and his pen names Sam Dawson and Jonathan Bundy. Johnstone wrote the last episodes of both <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> and <i>Suspense</i>. He used the Bundy pen name when writing the last <i>Suspense</i> episode, \"Devilstone\". And so, an era passed. <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> was the last continuing detective series of the Golden Age of Radio. Mandel Kramer was the last Johnny Dollar, and a close second in popularity to Bailey, when the final episode, \"The Tip-Off Matter\", was aired on September 30, 1962. <font size=\"1\">Material for this description was prepared by Stewart Wright.</font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

People often wonder how daredevils get that way and if they are normal human beings or suicidal maniacs. They are as normal as you and I and have no intent of self-destruction. With a yen for accomplishing what to many appears to be impossible in the way of daring feats, they have entered a bizarre profession where the money is good and they satisfy a public willing to pay for chills and thrills. But why pay to watch daredevils to perform? If you’ve got a television set in your home, sit back, relax, and get your share of thrills and chills watching the old adventure movies frequently shown, and, of course, the ever popular westerns. Look closely and you’re liable to see Yakima Canutt, perform his specialty of jumping from a stagecoach, onto the rear two animals of a six-horse team, then jump to the next two, and then up to the first two. Then Canutt, who usually gets $1,000 for this stunt, utters a prayer under his breath and then drops to the ground. Sure. You’ve seen this stunt a dozen times. Canutt allows the six-horse team thunder past him, then, as the wagon goes thundering past his body, he grabs the rear of the stagecoach and pulls himself up to the top. Many movies contain daring flying sequences staged by the king of the movie stunt pilots, Frank Clarke, who, before his death in 1948 from a plane accident not connected to any movie daredevilry, could make a plane do everything except eat out of his hand. And there were many other stunt daredevils, both men and women, who made the movie business exciting. In this series, you’ll hear many of their stories. We hope that you’ll enjoy them.</blockquote>",

It was created by <i>Fibber McGee and Molly</i> co-creator/writer Don Quinn before being adapted into a CBS television comedy (1954-55) produced by ITC Entertainment and Television Programs of America. British husband-and-wife actors Ronald Colman and Benita Hume starred in both versions of the show. Quinn developed the show after he had decided to leave <i>Fibber McGee and Molly</i> in the hands of his protege Phil Leslie. <i>The Halls of Ivy's</i> audition program featured radio veteran Gale Gordon (then co-starring in <i>Our Miss Brooks</i>) and Edna Best in the roles that ultimately went to the Colmans, who'd shown a flair for radio comedy in recurring roles on <i>The Jack Benny Program</i> in the late 1940s. <i>The Halls of Ivy</i> featured Colman as William Todhunter Hall, the president of small, Midwestern Ivy College, and his wife, Victoria, a former British musical comedy star who sometimes felt the tug of her former profession, and followed their interactions with students, friends and college trustees. Others in the cast included Herbert Butterfield as testy board chairman Clarence Wellman; Willard Waterman (then starring as Harold Peary's successor as <i>The Great Gildersleeve</i>) as board member John Merriweather; and, Elizabeth Patterson and Gloria Gordon as the Halls' maid. The series ran 110 half-hour radio episodes from January 6, 1950 to June 25, 1952, with Quinn, Jerome Lawrence, and Robert Lee writing most of the scripts and giving free if even more sophisticated play to Quinn's knack for language play, inverted cliches and swift puns (including the show's title and lead characters), a knack he'd shown for years writing <i>Fibber McGee and Molly</i>. Jerome Lawrence and Robert Lee continued as a writing team; their best-known play is <i>Inherit the Wind</i>. Cameron Blake, Walter Brown Newman, Robert Sinclair, and Milton and Barbara Merlin became writers for the program as well. But listeners were surprised to discover that the episode of 27 September 1950, \"The Leslie Hoff Painting,\" a story tackling racial prejudice, was written by Colman himself. The sponsors were Schlitz Brewing Company and then Nabisco. Nat Wolff produced and directed, Henry Russell handled the music and radio veteran Ken Carpenter was the announcer. <font size=\"2\">Information from Wikipedia</font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>The Halls of Ivy <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>January 28, 2010 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1.2 <b>Number of CDs: </b>2 <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

Created by Frances and Richard Lockridge, the couple were featured in a series of 26 Mr. and Mrs. North novels, a Broadway play, a motion picture and several radio and television series.<br /><br />Mr. and Mrs. North was a radio mystery series that aired on CBS from 1942 to 1954. Alice Frost and Joseph Curtin had the title roles when the series began in 1942. The characters, publisher Jerry North and his wife Pam, lived in Greenwich Village at 24 St. Anne's Flat. They were not professional detectives but simply an ordinary couple who stumbled across a murder or two every week for 12 years. The radio program eventually reached nearly 20 million listeners.<br /><br /><br /><b>Novels</b><br /><br />The characters originated in 1930s vignettes written by Richard Lockridge for the New York Sun, and he brought them back for short stories in The New Yorker. These stories were collected in Mr. and Mrs. North (1936). Lockridge increased the readership after he teamed with his wife Frances on a novel, The Norths Meet Murder (1940), launching a series of 26 novels, including Death Takes a Bow, Death on the Aisle and The Dishonest Murderer. Their long-run series continued for over two decades and came to an end in 1963 with the death of Frances Lockridge. The series was unusual in that it was Mrs. North who often solved the cases, while Mr. North was just background much of the time. In his article, \"Married Sleuths,\" Charles L.P. Silet captured the flavor of the novels:<br /><br /><blockquote>The Mr. and Mrs. North novels contain carefully crafted puzzles and the Lockridges usually play fair with their readers. The series also features Pam and Jerry's warmly humorous domestic environment and the couple's witty exchanges with the duller members of the police force. Although the Norths remain the focus of the series, the books contain a good deal of political and social commentary, a richly detailed look at the changing life in New York City, as well as glimpses of the outlying suburban counties. Also, the North's stable marriage relationship presents a marked contrast--and a welcome one--to the traditions of the lone detective characteristic of much other American mystery fiction. Even though the Mr. and Mrs. North novels now may appear overly deliberate in their pacing, they still prove wonderful reading as mysteries, and the glimpses they provide of our past social history give them a nostalgic and authentic period flavor. Aficionados of classic crime fiction have always appreciated this longrunning series, and new readers should be encouraged to discover this witty and charming couple.</blockquote><br /><br /><br /><b>Broadway and Film</b><br /><br />Albert Hackett and Peggy Conklin had the title roles in the Broadway production Mr. and Mrs. North, which ran 163 performances at the Belasco Theatre from January 12, 1941, to May 31, 1941. Alfred De Liagre, Jr. produced and directed the play written by Owen Davis. In that version, the North's apartment is located on Greenwich Place, realized in a scenic design by Jo Mielziner.<br /><br />The Owen Davis play became a 1942 MGM movie starring Gracie Allen and William Post, Jr. with Millard Mitchell repeating his role of Detective Mullins from the Broadway production. Others in the cast were Paul Kelly, Rose Hobart and Keye Luke.<br /><br /><br /><b>Radio</b><br /><br />In 1946, <i>Mr. and Mrs. North</i> received the first Best Radio Drama Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America (in a tie with CBS's <i>Ellery Queen</i>). The program, which was broadcast once in 1941 and continuously from December 1942 through December 1946 on NBC Radio (for Woodbury Soap), and from July 1947 to April 1955 on CBS Radio (for Colgate-Palmolive), featured Carl Eastman (1941), Joseph Curtin (1942-53) and Richard Denning (1953-55) as Jerry North. Pam North was played by Peggy Conklin (1941), Alice Frost (1942-53) and Barbara Britton (1953-55). In his book, <i>Radio Crime Fighters</i>, Jim Cox wrote that the couple:<br /><br /><blockquote>... who passed themselves off as a publisher and his homemaker-spouse continued to make lighthearted wisecracks as they stepped over bodies in dark alleys and were rendered unconscious by unknown assailants dispensing blows to the head almost every week... The feminine half of the twosome was at least equal to the husband in solving cases that often baffled law-enforcement officers with years of training and practice—except in reading clues. No explanation was given, of course, as to why a couple of misfits could be so successful in their preoccupation while the professionals thrashed about ineffectually.\"</blockquote><br /><br /><br /><b>Television</b><br /><br />In 1946, producer-director Fred Coe brought the Owen Davis play to television (on New York City's WNBT) with John McQuade and Maxine Stewart in the leads and Don Haggerty, Joan Marlowe and Millard Mitchell repeating their Broadway roles.<br /><br />Barbara Britton and Richard Denning starred in the tv adaptation, produced by John W. Loveton, seen on CBS from 1952 to 1953 and on NBC in 1954, sponsored by Revlon cosmetics. Francis De Sales starred in 25 episodes as police Lieutenant Bill Weigand, only his second screen role. Guest stars included Raymond Burr, Hans Conried, Russ Conway, Mara Corday, I. Stanford Jolley, Carolyn Jones, Katy Jurado, Jimmy Lydon, Dayton Lummis, Julia Meade, William Schallert, and Gloria Talbott.<br /><br />Sixteen episodes of the TV series have been released in the \"Best of TV Detectives\" box set.<br /><br />Mr. and Mrs. North were resurrected in spirit with ABC's Hart to Hart, the 1979-84 crime drama about a wealthy husband (Robert Wagner) and wife (Stefanie Powers) who spent as much time solving murders and romancing each other as pursuing careers as an industrialist and a journalist, played the crime theme with wry wit reminiscent of the Norths in their heyday.<br /><br /><br /><br /><font size=\"-2\">From WikiPedia.</font><br /><br /><hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b><br /><br /><b>Series Name: </b>Mr and Mrs North<br /><b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate<br /><b>Certification Date: </b>April 10, 2013<br /><b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1<br /><b>Number of CDs: </b>3<br /><br /><br />From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.  See \"Note\" Section below for more information on the OTRR.<br /></blockquote>",

All episodes are available. It starred Michael Dunn as Dr. Danfield, with JoAnne Johnson as Rusty Fairfax, his secretary. The series was written by Ralph Wilkinson and produced by Wally Ramsey. This series consistently featured some of the worst acting and writing of any detective show to reach the airwaves. The show had a formula with the crime usually being committed in the first third of the program, the good doctor solving it in the second third, and then pedantically explaining the solution to someone (usually his \"pretty, young\" secretary, Rusty) in the conclusion. Dr. Daniel Danfield was an obnoxious unlicensed private investigator/criminal psychologist with an ego complex. Why Rusty would put up with this guy is beyond understanding. In this case, love is not only blind, but also deaf and dumb. But then, Rusty was no prize package either. In fact, the most complex person on the show is Dr. Dan Danfield's pretty young secretary, Miss Rusty Fairfax. Why does Dr. Dan always call her Miss Fairfax? Dr. Dan goes to extremes to keep her at arm's length, but it's obvious he's just taunting her. After all, he's a criminal psychologist, and the way he treats Rusty is criminal! She can flare up, but usually just slow simmers in her professionally feminine way. Too bad one of the bad guys wasn't able to rub both of them out but these crooks were incredibly inept. Unfortunately, the toughs, society-types in trouble and the necessary law enforcement officers in this series, are nearly as individual as furniture in a model home. Still, if mindless detective drama is what you're looking for and you've tried the rest, then let Dr. Dan Danfield give you a little of a criminal psychologist's caseload. The show makes good drive-time or casual listening, since it doesn't make great demands on the emotions or intellect. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Danger, Dr Danfield <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>Feb 19, 2007 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Powell played private detective Richard Rogue, who trailed luscious blondes, protected witness, and did whatever else detectives do to make a living. It was a good series, though not destined to make much of a mark. Under the capable direction of Dee Englebach and accompanied by the music of Leith Stevens, Powell floated through his lines with the help of such competents as Lou Merrill, Gerald Mohr, Gloria Blondell, Tony Barrett, and Lurene Tuttle. Peter Leeds played Rogue's friend Eugor, an obscure play on names with Eugor spelling Rogue backwards. The gimmick in <i>Rogue's Gallery</i> was the presence of an alter ego, \"Eugor,\" who arrived in the middle of the show to give Rogue enough information for his final deduction. Eugor was a state of mind, achieved when Rogue was knocked unconcious. Eugor would appear cackling like the host of <i>Hermit's Cave</i> and imparted some vital information the hero had overlooked. Rogue would then awaken with a vague idea of what to do next. <i>Rogue's Gallery</i> also starred different actors as Rogue, in later incarnations of the series, but Richard Powell was the most popular. This series preceded Richard Powell's most famous series, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Richard_Diamond_Private_Detective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Diamond, Private Detective</a>. Rogue trailed lovely blondes and protected witnesses in the new tough guy persona of Dick Powell. This was the transition series for Powell in his quest to be recognized as an actor rather than a singer. It had some of the same cute elements that would make <i>Richard Diamond</i> a high spot four years later. During the summer of 1946, the show was billed as <i>Bandwagon Mysteries</i>, with a tip of the hat to the sponsor. In the summer of 1947, it was again revived on NBC Sundays for Fitch, with Barry Sullivan in the title role.

The documentary series was produced by Norman Corwin who was the recipient of the first One World Award by the Wendell Willkie Memorial and the Common Council for American Unity. First prize was a round-the-world trip. According to Time Magazine article of Monday, 27 Jan 1947, Norman Corwin began his trip in Jun 1947. He took with him CBS Recorder Lee Bland and 225 pounds of magnetic wire-recording equipment. The trip lasted four months, covered 42,000 miles and they visited 16 countries which produced 100 hours of recorded interviews. He interviewed heads of state and common people, people of all types regardless status or walks of life. The transcript alone produced 3700 typed pages.

As originally created by author Jack Boyle, he was a safecracker -- a hardened criminal who had served time in a California prison. Prowling the underworld as a detective in adaptations for films, radio, and television, the detective Boston Blackie was \"an enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend\". The <i>Boston Blackie</i> radio series, starring Chester Morris, began June 23, 1944, on NBC as a summer replacement for <i>The Amos 'n' Andy Show</i>. Sponsored by Rinso, the series continued until September 15 of that year. Unlike the concurrent films, Blackie had a steady romantic interest in the radio show -- Lesley Woods appeared as Blackie's girlfriend Mary Wesley. Harlow Wilcox was the show's announcer. On April 11, 1945, Richard Kollmar took over the title role in a radio series syndicated by Frederic W. Ziv to Mutual and other network outlets. Over 200 episodes of this series were produced between 1944 and October 25, 1950. Other sponsors included Lifebuoy Soap, Champagne Velvet beer, and R&H beer. While investigating mysteries, Blackie invaribly encountered harebrained Police Inspector Farraday (Maurice Tarplin) and always solved the mystery to Farraday's amazement. Initially, friction surfaced in the relationship between Blackie and Farraday, but as the series continued, Farraday recognized Blackie's talents and requested assistance. Blackie dated Mary Wesley (Jan Miner), and for the first half of the series, his best pal Shorty was always on hand.

During the 15 minute show Hank and the announcer Louie Buck would pitch the flour in between Hank's songs. Hank even wrote a theme song for the show. <blockquote> I love to have that gal around Her bicuits are so nice and brown Her pies and cakes beat all the rest Cause she makes them all with Mother's Best </blockquote> Hank was paid $100 a week for five shows. Often times, they were pre-recorded due to Hank's touring schedule. These shows are among Hank Williams most popular, if not his best, work. Perhaps the most well known, most sought collection in the Hank Williams catalogue are the <i>Mother's Best</i> radio shows. This collection of radio shows is considered by many to be Hank's best work and were done at the peak of his career in 1951. The show was broadcast live between 7:15 and 7:30 a.m. on WSM out of Nashville, Tennessee. Some of the shows were pre-recorded to be played on the air when Hank was out on the road. Hank was paid $100 a week for recording the shows that usually consisted of one country song, one instrumental and a gospel song to close the show, but that's not all they have to offer. The <i>Mother's Best</i> Shows capture Hank's personality better than anything else known to exist and they don't paint the picture of a sad, lonesome, forlorn man hell bent on drinking and death as many books and other publications try to portray him as. In fact, it is probably the in-between song chatter that makes these recordings so great, you get a glimpse of what Hank Williams was like as a person. The <i>Mother's Best</i> shows also featured a surprising variety of hymns, since there was at least one in every early-morning broadcast. A lesser-known Hank-penned uptempo jubilee number, \"I'm Gonna Sing\", is a highlight -- but so is his surprising three-part harmony singing with Drifting Cowboys Jerry Rivers and Cedric Rainwater on the likes of \"I Hear My Savior Calling Me\". Those expecting all lonesome barroom ballads and joking marital complaints should know that there's a lot of the gospel side of Hank on these discs. He shows a particular appreciation for songs by his Louisiana Hayride and Opry buddies the Bailes Brothers â \"Dust On The Bible\" and \"I've Got My One-Way Ticket To The Sky\", for instance. The Bailes' influence on Hank may have been as potent as that of Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. For all of the solemn spirituality, there's plenty of joking, in any case. We still hear Williams inform his female audience, \"Hey good lookin', if you've got anything cookin', just make sure you're cookin' it with Mother's Best Flour.\" This is a Hank very much in the world of his moment; he mentions the current pop hit version of \"On Top Of Old Smoky\" (it was by the Weavers) before launching into a great hard country version himself as an answer. <font size=\"-2\">(Some material for this series synopsis is from www.nodepression.com, and www.geocities.com/mothersbestshows. )</font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Mother's Best Flour <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>May 21, 2009 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>2 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">DRAGNET</font></b></u></i></p> <i>Dragnet</i>, the brainchild of Jack Webb, may very well be the most well-remembered, and the best, radio police drama series. From September, 1949 through February 1957, <i>Dragnet</i>'s 30 minute shows, broadcast on NBC, brought to radio true police stories in a low-key, documentary style. The origins of <i>Dragnet</i> can be traced to a semi-documentary film, \"He Walked by Night\" from 1948, in which Webb had a small role. Both employed the same Los Angeles Police Department technical adviser, used actual police cases and presented the case in \"just the facts\" manner that became a hallmark of <i>Dragnet</i>. It is interesting to note that Webb employed that format in other radio series, some pre-dating the film mentioned above. <i>Dragnet</i> was a long running radio and television police procedural drama, about the cases of a dedicated Los Angeles police detective, Sergeant Joe Friday, and his partners. The show takes its name from an actual police term, a <i>Dragnet</i>, meaning a system of coordinated measures for apprehending criminals or suspects. <i>Dragnet</i> was perhaps the most famous and influential police procedural drama in American media history. The series gave millions of Americans a feel for the boredom and drudgery, as well as the danger and heroism, of real life police work. <i>Dragnet</i> earned praise for improving the public opinion of police officers. Actor and producer Jack Webb's aims in <i>Dragnet</i> were for realism and unpretentious acting. He achieved both goals and <i>Dragnet</i> remains a key influence on subsequent police dramas in many media. The shows cultural impact is demonstrated by the fact that even after five decades, elements of <i>Dragnet</i> are known to those who have never heard nor seen the program. The ominous four note introduction to the brass and tympani theme music, titled <i>Danger Ahead</i>, is instantly recognizable as well as the shows opening narration: <blockquote> <i>\"Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to hear is true. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent.\"</i> </blockquote> The original <i>Dragnet</i> starring Jack Webb as Sergeant Joe Friday ran on radio from June 3rd, 1949 to February 26th, 1957; and on television from December 16th, 1951 to August 23rd, 1959, and from January 12th, 1967 to April 16th, 1970. All of these versions ran on NBC. There were two <i>Dragnet</i> feature films, a straight adaptation starring Jack Webb in 1954, and a comedy spoof in 1987. There were also television revivals, without Webb, in 1989 and 2003. <i>Dragnet</i> debuted inauspiciously. The first several months were bumpy, as Webb and company worked out the program's format and eventually became comfortable with their characters. Friday was originally portrayed as more brash and forceful than his later usually relaxed demeanor. Gradually, Friday's deadpanned, fast-talking persona emerged, described by John Dunning as \"a cop's cop: tough, but not hard; conservative, but caring\". Friday's first partner was Sergeant Ben Romero, portrayed by Barton Yarborough, a long time radio actor When <i>Dragnet</i> hit its stride, it became one of radio's top rated shows. Webb insisted on realism in every aspect of the show. The dialogue was clipped, understated, and sparse -- influenced by the hard-boiled school of crime fiction. Scripts were fast moving, but didn't seem rushed. Every aspect of police work was chronicled, step-by-step. From patrols and paperwork, to crime scene investigation, lab work and questioning witnesses or suspects. Webb was a stickler for accurate details, and <i>Dragnet</i> used many authentic touches, such as LAPD's actual radio call sign, KMA-367, and the names of many real department officials, such as Ray Pinker and Lee Jones of the Crime Lab, or Chief of Detectives, Thad Brown. Two announcers were used. Episodes began with announcer George Fennemen intoning the series opening: <blockquote> <i>\"The story you are about to hear is true. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent.\"</i> </blockquote> Hal Gibney described the basic premise of the episode. For example, \"Big Saint\", from April 26th, 1951, begins with: <blockquote> <i>\"You're a detective sergeant. You're assigned to auto theft detail. A well organized ring of car thieves begins operations in your city. It's one of the most puzzling cases you've ever encountered. Your job -- break it.\"</i> </blockquote> The story usually began with footsteps and a door closing, followed by Joe Friday intoning something like: <blockquote> <i>\"Tuesday, February 12th. It was cold in Los Angeles. We were working the day watch out of Robbery Division. My partner's Ben Romero. The boss is Ed Backstrom, Chief of Detectives. My name's Friday.\"</i> </blockquote> Friday offered voice-over narration throughout the episodes, noting the time, date, and place of every scene as he and his partners went through their day investigating the crime. The events related in a given episode might occur in a few hours or might span a few months. At least one episode unfolded in real time, in \"City Hall Bombing\", from July 21st, 1949. Friday and Romero had less than 30 minutes to stop a man who was threatening to destroy the City Hall with a bomb. At the end of an episode, announcer Hal Gibney would relate the fate of the suspect. They were usually convicted of a crime, and sent to the state penitentiary or a state mental hospital. Murderers were often executed in the manner proscribed by law. Occasionally, police pursued the wrong suspect, and criminals sometimes avoided justice, or escaped, at least on the radio version of <i>Dragnet</i>. Scripts tackled a number of topics, ranging from the thrilling (murders, missing persons, and armed robbery) to the mundane (check fraud and shoplifting) -- yet, <i>Dragnet</i> made them all interesting due to the fast moving plots and behind the scenes realism. In \"The Garbage Chute\", from December 15th, 1949, they even had a locked-room mystery. Though rather tame by modern standards, <i>Dragnet</i>, especially on the radio, handled controversial subjects, such as sex crimes and drug addiction, with unprecedented and even startling realism. The tone was usually serious, but there were moments of comic relief. Romero was something of a hypochondriac, and often seemed hen-pecked. Though Friday dated women, he usually dodged those who tried to set him up with marriage-minded dates. Due in part to Webb's fondness for radio drama, <i>Dragnet</i> persisted on radio until 1957, as one of the last old time radio shows to give way to television's increasing popularity. In fact, the TV show would prove to be effectively a visual version of the radio show, as the style was virtually the same. The TV show could be listened to, without watching it, with no loss of understanding of the storyline. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Dragnet <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>February 25, 2013 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 3 <b>Number of CDs: </b>10 <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

It was a fifteen minute weekly serial heard every Monday for 36 weeks beginning January 31st, 1938 and running through the 3rd of October of 1938. It may have been on the air as early as 1935, although there’s no actual proof of this. Little is known of the series other than it followed the exploits of Sgt. Blair of the Northwest Mounted Police. and probably was the inspiration for Trendell, Campbell and Muir's <i>Challenge of the Yukon</i>. The series was written by Colonel Rhys Davies, who also played the Colonel Blair in the series. Jack Abbot played the Constable. Jack French, one of OTR’s best researchers says this about the series: “Blair is not restricted to Canada, as other Mounties, as we find him, in a few cases, in Great Britain, solving cases.

    "description": "<blockquote><br /><p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">THE DAMON RUNYON THEATRE</font></b></u></i></p><br /><br /><i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i> was another of Alan Ladd's Mayfair Transcription Company productions. Ladd, long an admirer of 'The Brighter Side', Damon Runyon's long-running newspaper column, initially signed Pat O'Brien to star as 'Broadway' in the program. Indeed we have an alleged audition from the program, titled \"Princess O'Hara\" in which O'Brien and Wendy Barrie are heard announcing the next production of the series, 'A Piece of Pie'. Newspaper listings of the era describe Pat O'Brien slated to cut all 52 programs upon completing principal filming of the Howard Hughes/RKO feature, <i>The Boy with Green Hair</i>. But the quixotic Hughes decided the 'message' element of <i>The Boy with Green Hair</i> was a bit too risky for late-1940s audiences. He directed that the film be re-shot, as needed, to remove the social intolerance message from the completed celluloid.<br /><br />Newspaper accounts cite O'Brien as anticipating a New York recording session for all 52 episodes of <i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i> sometime during the Summer of 1948. But owing to the re-shoot and re-cutting of <i>The Boy with Green Hair</i>, the movie wasn't completed until September of 1948. This may--or may not--explain Pat O'Brien's absence from the remaining episodes of <i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i>--or whether any were recorded beyond Princess O'Hara. Given the common practice of cutting two to five transcribed recordings in one session, one might well imagine that O'Brien recorded as many as five Damon Runyon Theatre programs before his performances were cut short. But it's intriguing to wonder how many of the episodes they actually did record before O'Brien had to rush back to RKO's West Coast studios to complete <i>The Boy with Green Hair</i>.<br /><br />As it turns out, Ladd tapped short-lived veteran Radio actor John Brown to voice the recurring 'Broadway' character so central to the exposition of every episode of <i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i>. As most fans of the program would attest, John Brown's 'Broadway' was as good as it gets in Radio. Brown had already begun performing a similar character on <i>My Friend Irma</i> (1947) as Irma's (Marie Wilson) shiftless boyfriend, so the leap to yet another Lower East Side accent wasn't that great for Brown. Indeed, one wonders if Brown ever got out of character for the seven years that <i>My Friend Irma</i> aired over CBS.<br /><br />Yet another stumbling block for many new programs produced in 1948 was the infamous 'Petrillo Ban' on producing any new professional Radio recordings. The following is from the <i>Time Magazine</i> article of December 29, 1947:<br /><br /><blockquote>\"Cocky little James Caesar Petrillo just sat back and waited. Recording companies rushed symphony orchestras, hillbilly bands and blues singers in & out of studios, trying to record as much as possible by January 1, when Petrillo's ban on record-making becomes effective. Record officials gloated that they had piled up a big enough backlog of new records to last a year or more. They were hopeful that Petrillo's Musicians' Union might not be able to stand so long a layoff.<br /><br />Last week, James Petrillo pointed his stubby finger at a point they had apparently overlooked. The Taft-Hartley law prevented record companies from signing a new contract which would pay royalties to a union-administered fundâbut the record companies had obligingly recorded a year's supply under the old contract. All those phonograph records to be doled out over the bleak months ahead, he thought, would net his union around $10,000,000.<br /><br />The record companies looked as if they had been hit over the head with a kettledrum. Together with men from radio, television, and phonograph manufacturers, they formed a united industry committee to fight Petrillo. But Petrillo wasn't budging an inch: \"We are never going to make records againâever. That's one New Year's resolution we've made and one we are going to keep.\"</blockquote><br /><br />James Caesar Petrillo was president of the American Federation of Musicians, who had successfully imposed a ban on professional recordings between 1942 and 1944 until an appropriate royalty system could be established to the benefit of his union members. Petrillo successfully reimposed the ban for most of 1948--it was finally lifted on November 22, 1948. Indeed, then Freshman Congressman Richard M. Nixon made headlines taking up the cudgel for the Recording Industry in an attempt to thwart Petrillo's union.<br /><br />This is the reason the same music theme is employed in both the alleged Pat O'Brien audition recordings and the final production pressings of <i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i>. Having dodged two potential stumbling blocks, Ladd's <i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i> was first aired over independent radio station KSEL, Lubbock, Texas.<br /><br />The program was soon heard over most major outlets between November 1948 and December 1951. As with Mayfair's other syndicated programs, the production quality and engineering is superb. Veteran Mayfair producer Vern Carstensen again supervises the production and Richard Sanville directs. Mayfair writer Russell Hughes adapts Damon Runyon's wonderful short stories, maintaining the very Runyonesque flavor of both the dialogue and settings.<br /><br />But what is it that makes a character or storyline Runyonesque? For three generations of Americans, a Damon Runyon character evoked a social archetype from the Brooklyn or Midtown demi-monde elements of New York society. Think of it as the Bizarro World version of New York's 'The 400'. Runyon spun fascinating, tongue-incheek tales of gamblers, hustlers, actors, and gangsters--and their dolls. Most self-respecting denizens of Runyon's fanciful world preferred colorful monikers such as 'Nathan Detroit,' 'Big Jule,' 'Harry the Horse Thief,' 'Good Time Charlie,' 'Dave the Dude,' or 'The Seldom Seen Kid.'<br /><br />Runyon spun his tales in a uniquely vernacular style that mixed overly formal speech with richly colored slang. This idiomatic language was invariably spoken in the present tense, quite deliberately devoid of any contractions. Runyon is credited as the first major American writer to \"stylize both the language and the behavior of gangsters and depict them as another part of the socio-economic system, showing how the underworld provided clients with gambling, sex and hard-to-get sports tickets and, during Prohibition, with liquor,\" according to Cornell University English Professor, Daniel Schwarz.<br /><br />Runyon's flamboyant street characters, with their aggressive one-line retorts, have shaped the world's image of 20th Century New York City for over eighty years. That's the charm and flavor that makes each of these recordings so timeless. Those familiar with Runyon's work will remember that the famous Frank Sinatra/Marlon Brando vehicle <i>Guys and Dolls</i> (1955) was based on Damon Runyon's unique vision of New York City and its inhabitants--and the long-running play of the same name. Indeed, had <i>Guys and Dolls</i> been filmed six years earlier, one might well imagine that <i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i> may have been named <i>Guys and Dolls</i>.<br /><br />The Mayfair rendition of Damon Runyon's fascinating world remains as true to form and substance as both the 1200-performance <i>Guys and Dolls</i> stage play and the Oscar-nominated <i>Guys and Dolls</i> film. Runyon's most celebrated short stories were spun into a 52-week long, seamless atmosphere of a New York City that shaped popular perceptions of The Big Apple throughout the remainder of the Golden Age of Radio and the Golden Age of Television as well. Veteran dialecticians Gerald Mohr, Herb Vigran, Sheldon Leonard, Luis Van Rooten, Alan Reed and Lionel Stander gave every program of the run an authenticity and indelible flavor that were imitated in both Radio and Television for decades to come.<br /><br /><i>The Damon Runyon Theatre</i> stands as one of Mayfair's finest contributions to The Golden Age of Radio and remains a valuable addition to any Golden Age Radio collector's library. As an artifact of American Society it represents an invaluable time capsule of period vernacular. But most of all it stands as an enduring reminder of the genius of Damon Runyon's insight into the class warfare that evolved during and after the Roaring 20s and The Great Depression.<br /><br /><br /><br /><font size=\"-2\">From <a href=\"http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Damon-Runyon-Theatre.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Digital Deli Too</a>.</font><br /><br /><br />From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

Ironically, the episode was titled \"Devil Stone\" and was the last dramatic radio play from a series that had its roots in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-time_radio\" rel=\"nofollow\">golden age of radio. </a>. What began as a \"new series frankly dedicated to your horrification and entertainment\" took on a life of its own mostly due to the talents of some outstanding producers and adaptations and original stories from the cream of mystery writers of the time. The golden age of radio was truly the golden age of <i>SUSPENSE</i> as show after show broadcast outstanding plays which were \"calculated to intrigue...stir [the] nerves.\" It was the series' first producer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Spier\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Spier</a>, who set the framework of rules that was to stay with the show for most of its run. Mr. Spier determined that the series should deal with life-and-death situations established near the beginning of each play and then through the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bernard_Herrmann</a>'s musical coloring and the writer's characterizations slowly tighten the knot of <i>SUSPENSE</i>. Many of the early stories were written by the mystery writer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dickson_Carr\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Dickson Carr</a>. Others were by such fine writers as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Fletcher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Fletcher</a>, whose <i>SUSPENSE</i> play, \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry,_Wrong_Number#Radio_play\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sorry, Wrong Number</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1943/Suspense_430525_043_Sorry_Wrong_Number_128-44_28100_29m17s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/download)</a> was turned into a major motion picture; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Arthur,_Jr.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Arthur</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Richards\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert L. Richards</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton_Fine\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morton Fine</a> and David Friedkin. The series also drew from the mystery writers of the day as well as the horror writers of literature; writers such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edgar Allan Poe</a> , <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft\" rel=\"nofollow\">H.

Sayers</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells\" rel=\"nofollow\">H. G. Wells</a>. Many of the stories produced by Mr. Spier are now classics of the genre. Listen to the likes of \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_in_Cypress_Canyon\" rel=\"nofollow\">The House in Cypress Canyon</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1946/Suspense_461205_222_The_House_in_Cypress_Canyon_128-44_28764_30m20s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/downoad)</a> as a young couple encounters something in the closet of their new home, something horrible and dangerous; or \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitch-Hiker_%28radio_play%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">The_Hitch-Hiker</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1942/Suspense_420902_011_The_Hitch-Hiker_128-44_29227_30m50s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/download)</a> in which a man driving cross-country seems to be haunted by an ominous figure, who keeps reappearing trying to get a ride. But what foreboding does the hitchhiker hold for the driver? Another rule William Spier established was to make the series a place to hear the talents of Hollywood's famous actors. There rarely was a famous actor who did not appear on the series at some time. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Stewart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jimmy_Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cary Grant</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Humphrey Bogart</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Ball</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olivia de Havilland</a> and many others all made at least one appearance. The series had a generous budget from its network, CBS. In 1948 the series had become popular enough that it was decided to broadcast for a complete hour, instead of the former thirty minutes. The actor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_%28actor%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Montgomery</a> was brought in to introduce the plays, replacing the \"Man in Black\" character and occasionally star in them. This format lasted only six months most probably due to the realization that the show worked best within a thirty minute framework. It was at this time that William Spier left and over the years others came to produce the shows, each setting his own unique mark. Anton M. Leader, who came from producing another horror radio program, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_at_Midnight_%28radio_series%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Murder_at_Midnight</a>, added some lighter <i>SUSPENSE</i> stories which focused more on the central characters. Jimmy Stewart appeared in an excellent story about a paralysed war veteran who thinks he has found the man who imprisoned and tortured him. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fibber McGee and Molly</a> appeared in a tale about a killer on the loose in \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1949/Suspense_490203_326_Backseat_Driver_128-44_28499_30m03s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backseat Driver</a>.\" Probably the biggest change in <i>SUSPENSE</i> came under the producing eye of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Lewis_%28radio%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elliott Lewis</a>. Lewis brought in comic actors to play serious roles. Actors such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Benny\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Benny</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Skelton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Skelton</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzie_Nelson\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ozzie Nelson</a>. He also was not afraid to experiment using the series slot for classic \"murder\" stories such as \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello\" rel=\"nofollow\">Othello</a>.\" The series continued to produce high-quality drama, though there were many repeats as well as borrowing of scripts from other radio shows. While a number of film actors continued to star occasionally, many of the stars were from radio and television since radio as a dramatic art form was beginning to lose its popularity and budgets were tightened. The show was on the air for a little over twenty years beginning in January, 1942 and was rarely pre-empted. There were 947 performances. Nearly all (approximately 895) are available to collectors. When <i>SUSPENSE</i> left the air, radio was never to see the likes of such a series again. Now the great medium of radio where imagination can run free has been reduced to the occasional brilliant drama airing sporadically in some corner of the world. <i>SUSPENSE</i> was a golden moment in a golden age. A moment when the thrill of the nightime led the listener along the path of intrigue, horror and dangerous adventure.

Quinn developed the show after he had decided to leave <i>Fibber McGee and Molly</i> in the hands of his protege Phil Leslie. <i>The Halls of Ivy's</i> audition program featured radio veteran Gale Gordon (then co-starring in <i>Our Miss Brooks</i>) and Edna Best in the roles that ultimately went to the Colmans, who'd shown a flair for radio comedy in recurring roles on <i>The Jack Benny Program</i> in the late 1940s. <i>The Halls of Ivy</i> featured Colman as William Todhunter Hall, the president of small, Midwestern Ivy College, and his wife, Victoria, a former British musical comedy star who sometimes felt the tug of her former profession, and followed their interactions with students, friends and college trustees. Others in the cast included Herbert Butterfield as testy board chairman Clarence Wellman; Willard Waterman (then starring as Harold Peary's successor as <i>The Great Gildersleeve</i>) as board member John Merriweather; and, Elizabeth Patterson and Gloria Gordon as the Halls' maid. The series ran 110 half-hour radio episodes from January 6, 1950 to June 25, 1952, with Quinn, Jerome Lawrence, and Robert Lee writing most of the scripts and giving free if even more sophisticated play to Quinn's knack for language play, inverted cliches and swift puns (including the show's title and lead characters), a knack he'd shown for years writing <i>Fibber McGee and Molly</i>. Jerome Lawrence and Robert Lee continued as a writing team; their best-known play is <i>Inherit the Wind</i>. Cameron Blake, Walter Brown Newman, Robert Sinclair, and Milton and Barbara Merlin became writers for the program as well. But listeners were surprised to discover that the episode of 27 September 1950, \"The Leslie Hoff Painting,\" a story tackling racial prejudice, was written by Colman himself. The sponsors were Schlitz Brewing Company and then Nabisco. Nat Wolff produced and directed, Henry Russell handled the music and radio veteran Ken Carpenter was the announcer. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated with Version 1.2 MP3s (26-Feb-2011). </font></b></i></p> <font size=\"2\">Information from Wikipedia</font></blockquote>",

Ironically, the episode was titled \"Devil Stone\" and was the last dramatic radio play from a series that had its roots in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-time_radio\" rel=\"nofollow\">golden age of radio. </a>. What began as a \"new series frankly dedicated to your horrification and entertainment\" took on a life of its own mostly due to the talents of some outstanding producers and adaptations and original stories from the cream of mystery writers of the time. The golden age of radio was truly the golden age of <i>SUSPENSE</i> as show after show broadcast outstanding plays which were \"calculated to intrigue...stir [the] nerves.\" It was the series' first producer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Spier\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Spier</a>, who set the framework of rules that was to stay with the show for most of its run. Mr. Spier determined that the series should deal with life-and-death situations established near the beginning of each play and then through the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bernard_Herrmann</a>'s musical coloring and the writer's characterizations slowly tighten the knot of <i>SUSPENSE</i>. Many of the early stories were written by the mystery writer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dickson_Carr\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Dickson Carr</a>. Others were by such fine writers as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Fletcher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Fletcher</a>, whose <i>SUSPENSE</i> play, \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry,_Wrong_Number#Radio_play\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sorry, Wrong Number</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1943/Suspense_430525_043_Sorry_Wrong_Number_128-44_28100_29m17s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/download)</a> was turned into a major motion picture; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Arthur,_Jr.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Arthur</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Richards\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert L. Richards</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton_Fine\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morton Fine</a> and David Friedkin. The series also drew from the mystery writers of the day as well as the horror writers of literature; writers such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edgar Allan Poe</a> , <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft\" rel=\"nofollow\">H.

Sayers</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells\" rel=\"nofollow\">H. G. Wells</a>. Many of the stories produced by Mr. Spier are now classics of the genre.

But what foreboding does the hitchhiker hold for the driver? Another rule William Spier established was to make the series a place to hear the talents of Hollywood's famous actors. There rarely was a famous actor who did not appear on the series at some time. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Stewart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jimmy_Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cary Grant</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Humphrey Bogart</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Ball</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olivia de Havilland</a> and many others all made at least one appearance. The series had a generous budget from its network, CBS. In 1948 the series had become popular enough that it was decided to broadcast for a complete hour, instead of the former thirty minutes. The actor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_%28actor%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Montgomery</a> was brought in to introduce the plays, replacing the \"Man in Black\" character and occasionally star in them. This format lasted only six months most probably due to the realization that the show worked best within a thirty minute framework. It was at this time that William Spier left and over the years others came to produce the shows, each setting his own unique mark. Anton M. Leader, who came from producing another horror radio program, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_at_Midnight_%28radio_series%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Murder_at_Midnight</a>, added some lighter <i>SUSPENSE</i> stories which focused more on the central characters. Jimmy Stewart appeared in an excellent story about a paralysed war veteran who thinks he has found the man who imprisoned and tortured him. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fibber McGee and Molly</a> appeared in a tale about a killer on the loose in \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1949/Suspense_490203_326_Backseat_Driver_128-44_28499_30m03s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backseat Driver</a>.\" Probably the biggest change in <i>SUSPENSE</i> came under the producing eye of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Lewis_%28radio%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elliott Lewis</a>. Lewis brought in comic actors to play serious roles. Actors such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Benny\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Benny</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Skelton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Skelton</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzie_Nelson\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ozzie Nelson</a>. He also was not afraid to experiment using the series slot for classic \"murder\" stories such as \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello\" rel=\"nofollow\">Othello</a>.\" The series continued to produce high-quality drama, though there were many repeats as well as borrowing of scripts from other radio shows. While a number of film actors continued to star occasionally, many of the stars were from radio and television since radio as a dramatic art form was beginning to lose its popularity and budgets were tightened. The show was on the air for a little over twenty years beginning in January, 1942 and was rarely pre-empted. There were 947 performances. Nearly all (approximately 895) are available to collectors. When <i>SUSPENSE</i> left the air, radio was never to see the likes of such a series again. Now the great medium of radio where imagination can run free has been reduced to the occasional brilliant drama airing sporadically in some corner of the world. <i>SUSPENSE</i> was a golden moment in a golden age. A moment when the thrill of the nightime led the listener along the path of intrigue, horror and dangerous adventure.

In short, audiences were dwindling. To combat the problem, NBC spent lots of money to produce <i>The Big Show</i>, a 90 minute radio program which would feature famous guests performing skits, songs, and comedic routines. Tallulah Bankhead was asked to host the show. She had guested in various radio programs in the past but had never done anything on an ongoing basis before. She was nervous and didn't really know what to expect or what her duty actually was so she approached the show with guarded anticipation. <i>The Big Show</i> premiered on November 5, 1950 and played every Sunday night for the next three years. It was a rousing success and Tallulah was a great success. The guest list varied but included such names as Ethel Merman, Danny Thomas, Fanny Brice, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Clifton Webb, Gloria Swanson, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Holliday, Ethel Barrymore, Jimmy Durante, Milton Berle, Josephine Baker, Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh, George Sanders, Yul Brynner, Shirley Booth, Peggy Lee, Rosalind Russell and Merv Griffin. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

    "description": "DOWN OUR WAY Not much is known about this series. A search on the internet turned up virtually nothing, and it is not mentioned in any of the reference books, except for a short blurb in Jay Hickerson’s Ultimate Guide. However, it is a very entertaining show. The storyline revolves around neighbors helping neighbors, and using their faith in their daily lives. Believed to have been made in the early 1930s, the series is accented with the main characters practicing their choir hymnals. It was a much simpler time and given today’s atmosphere, it would be great to have that time return. You can go back, if only for 30 minutes at a time.

The name \"Black Museum\" was coined in 1877 by a reporter from \"The Observer\", a London newspaper, although the museum is still referred to as the Crime Museum. It is this museum that inspired <i>The Black Museum</i> radio series, produced in London by Harry Alan Towers. From Jay Hickerson's \"The Ultimate History of Network Radio Programming and Guide To All Circulating Shows\", the earliest US broadcast date was January 1, 1952. Thirty nine shows, from the full syndication of fifty two shows, aired over Mutual stations from January 1, 1952 through June 24, 1952 and September 30, 1952 through December 30, 1952. This may be the earliest broadcast of the series worldwide. It was later broadcast over Radio Luxembourg starting May 7, 1953. Radio Luxembourg broadcast sponsored programs at night to England (the BBC was state-owned and had no commercials). The shows were sponsored by Dreft and Mirro (cleaning products). The series continued to be offered in syndication and was heard on AFRTS broadcasts and in the US on NPR stations through the 1960's, 70's and 80's. Some shows were broadcast by the BBC in England in 1994. This murder mystery series was based on true life cases from Scotland Yard's files. Each episode was based on an item or items of evidence in the museum. Orsen Welles hosted and narrated the shows. Mr. Welles opened each show slightly differently but followed a standard format. For example, the show, \"The Bathtub\", open as follows: <blockquote>\"This is Orson Welles speaking from London.\" (Big Ben starts himing in the background). \"The Black Museum, repository of death... Here, in this grim stone structure on the Thames which houses Scotland Yard, is a warehouse of homocide, where everyday objects, a piece of wire, a chemist's flask, a silver shilling, all are touched by murder.\" (dramatic music)</blockquote> Following the opening, Mr. Welles would introduce the museum's item or items of evidence that was central to the case, leading into the dramatization. He also provided narration during the show and ended each show with his characteristic closing from the days of his <i>Mercury Theater of the Air</i>, remaining \"obediently yours\". Harry Alan Towers produced the series from scripts written by Ira Marion. Music was composed and conducted by Sidney Torch. The museum was not open to the general public. It's purpose was then, and still is, for police training, although it did receive a considerable number of famous people, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is currently used as a lecture theater for the police and like bodies in various subjects of Criminology. But, thanks to Mr. Towers and Mr. Welles, we can still get a glimpse of what secrets are housed in <i>The Black Museum</i>. From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

The character made his first appearance in August of 1939 in the comic book Mystery Men #1, published by Fox Features Syndicate. <i>The Blue Beetle</i> radio serial aired from 05-15-40 to 09-13-40 as a CBS 30 minutes, syndicated series. Actor Frank Lovejoy provided the voice of the Blue Beetle for the first thirteen episodes. Later episodes were uncredited. After his father was killed by a gangster's bullet, young Dan Garrett joined the New York Police Department, but soon tired of the slow pace and red tape of police work. With the help of his friend and mentor, pharmacist and drug-store proprietor Dr. Franz, Dan acquired a costume of bullet-proof chain-mail-like cellulose material, and began a second life, fighting crime as The Blue Beetle. His calling card was a small beetle-shaped marker that he left in conspicuous places to alert criminals to his presence, using their fear of his crime fighting reputation as a weapon against them. For this purpose he also used a \"Beetle Signal\" flashlight. The Blue Beetle's reputation was not his only weapon -- he carried a revolver in a blue holster on his belt, and was sometimes shown wearing a multi-pouched belt after the style set by Batman. Also in the Batman vein, the Blue Beetle had a \"BeetleMobile\" car and a \"BeetleBird\" airplane. In at least one radio adventure, he carries something called a \"magic ray machine\". The ray machine was a sort of super-scientific cutting device. From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group. See \"Note\" Section below for more information on the OTRR. </blockquote>",

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">JUMP JUMP AND THE ICE QUEEN</font></b></u></i></p> Jump Jump, the 3-inch tall Elf was first conceived by the creative writing team of Mary McConnell and hubby Harry Hickox as an anchor character to introduce an initial series of some 65 vignettes of delightfully animated creature-based children's stories for year round, syndicated distribution through the Harry S. Goodman organization to radio stations across America. That initial syndication caught both the attention and entrepreneurial interest of Sampson R. Diamond, who sought to put a physical image and visual personality to the delightful 3-inch tall Elf. He contracted with the Hickox' syndicator, Harry S. Goodman to contract out the Hickox's for a 25-episode children's adventure anchored around the Christmas Holiday season. Thus was born the first image of Jump Jump and a fully fleshed out package of Jump Jump characters, dolls, merchandise displays and marketing materials to promote the new 25-episode serial as a Christmas adventure. This is similar to the highly successful <i>Cinnamon Bear</i> and <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Jonathan_Thomas_And_His_Christmas_On_The_Moon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jonathan Thomas and His Christmas On The Moon</a> adventure serials distributed almost ten years earlier. These Christmas adventure serials were rapidly becoming a recurring holiday tradition over radio stations across the U.S. and Canada. So it was that Jump Jump's serial length adventure, <i>Jump-Jump and The Ice Queen</i>, was born. <font size=\"-2\">Text courtesy of the Digitaldeli Two</font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Jump Jump and the Ice Queen <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>September 14, 2011 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\"> LUX RADIO THEATRE</font></b></u></i></p> <i>Lux Radio Theatre</i> was indisputably the biggest, most important, most expensive drama anthology program on radio. It ran from October 14, 1934 until June 7, 1955, then continued on television as <i>Lux Video Theatre</i> until 1957. In all, some 926 episodes were broadcast, providing a record of the most important entertainment events in American theatre and, later, film. The show was first broadcast on the NBC Blue Network on Sundays at 2:30 PM. The show featured adaptations of successful Broadway plays when it was produced out of New York, such as <i>Seventh Heaven</i>, the first production starring Miriam Hopkins, <i>Smilin' Through</i>, <i>Berkeley Square</i>, <i>Daddy Long Legs</i>, <i>Peg O' My Heart</i> and <i>Way Down East</i>. On July 29, 1935, the show moved to Monday night at 9:00 PM on CBS, where it would stay until June 29, 1954. The show moved to Hollywood on May 25, 1936 with the production of <i>The Legionnaire and the Lady</i>, based on the film <i>Morocco</i>, starring Marlene Dietrich and Clark Gable. The audience for this production was estimated as high as 40 million. The show featured many of the most important films of the period, adapted to fit the 60 minute time slot. Some of the titles for 1939 should indicate the caliber and range of shows: <i>Stage Door</i>, <i>Ceiling Zero</i>, <i>So Big</i>, <i>It Happened One Night</i>, <i>Lives of a Bengal Lancer</i>, <i>Lady for a Day</i>, <i>The Life of Emile Zola</i>, <i>Tovarich</i>, <i>Only Angels Have Wings</i>, <i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i>, <i>The Awful Truth</i>, <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, <i>You Can’t Take It With You</i>, <i>The Old Maid</i> and <i>Goodbye, Mr. Chips</i>. For its last season, (1954-1955), the show moved to Tuesday nights at 9 on NBC. <i>Lux Radio Theatre</i> was always broadcast live, with a studio audience and a full orchestra accompanying the performance and providing musical transitions between scenes. As many film actors were used to numerous takes and not live performance, they sometimes suffered acute stage fright before the show. However, since most received $5,000 for their performance – in addition to free publicity for upcoming pictures – actors appeared in their original screen roles if they were available. Indeed, production would halt if necessary on a film if performers were called to appear on Lux. When the actors were not available, others stepped in. The plays were assembled and rehearsed for a week, in sharp contrast to many other shows, which required a minimal of an actor’s time. Regular players for the series included Jim and Marian Jordan, otherwise known as Fibber McGee and Molly. Hosts included Cecil B. DeMille (1936-1945), William Keighley (1945-1952) and Irving Cummings (1952-1955). Directors included Tony Stanford, Frank Woodruff, Fred MacKaye and Earl Ebi. When broadcast on the Arms Forces Radio Service in the early 1950s, the show was re-titled Hollywood Radio Theatre and hosted by Don Wilson. Similar shows include <i>Academy Award Theatre</i>, <i>The Campbell Playhouse, <i>Screen Director’s Playhouse</i> and <i>The Screen Guild Theater</i>. <font size=\"-2\"></font> <b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Lux Radio Theatre <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>January 27, 2015 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of DVDs/CDs: </b>8/47 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

References to the Ranch Boys are found as early as 1930, though they may have been on earlier. They broadcast over KTM those first few years, nearly every day and at various times. Jack Ross, a versatile actor and producer apparently served as Pinto Pete, with Joe \"Curley\" Bradley and Ken \"Shorty\" Carson rounding out the trio. All three had acted as stuntmen. They also appeared in a few movies, including <i>It Happened One Night</i> and <i>In Old Monterey</i>. The first recorded notice of the <i>Pinto Pete and His Ranch Boys</i> that researcher Ben Kibler was able to locate was a December 13, 1933 broadcast in Sandusky, Ohio. Mentions of the broadcast appeared through 1936. In 1935, they auditioned for the Tom Mix radio show in Chicago and Curley got the part of \"Pecos\", Ross got the lead of \"Tom Mix\", and Carson was to play bit parts. But Ross only got to play Mix once. While in Hollywood doing some movies in the summer of 1938, they rode their horses from Hollywood to Chicago in a publicity stunt that landed them on <i>National Barn Dance</i> for three months. Researcher Ryan Ellett perused the Los Angeles Times from 1930 to 1935 and turned up a few mentions that indicate the trio might have moved on to better pastures. Producer Grace Gibson introduced Australia to <i>Pinto Pete And The Ranch Boys</i> about 1934, according to researcher Ian Grieves, and the program was heard off and on through 1944. They were on the Blue Network in the U.S., according to a 1940 magazine ad, and on a Phoenix Arizona station in 1952. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">See also the OTRR Companion Release <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Pinto_Pete_in_Arizona\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pinto Pete in Arizona</a>.</font></b></i></p> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Johnny was an accomplished 'padder' of his expense account. The name of the show derives from the fact that he closed each show by totaling his expense account, and signing it \"End of report... Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\". Terry Salomonson in his authoritative \"A Radio Broadcast Log of the Drama Program Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", notes that the original working title was \"Yours Truly, Lloyd London\". Salomonson writes \"Lloyd London was scratched out of the body of (the Dick Powell) audition script and Johnny Dollar was written in. Thus the show was re-titled on this script and the main character was renamed. Why this was done was unclear â possibly to prevent a legal run-in with Lloydâs of London Insurance Company.\" Although based in Hartford, Connecticut, the insurance capital of the world, freelancer Johnny Dollar managed to get around quite a bit â his adventures taking him all over the world. There were some unusual devices used in the show that help set it apart from other shows. There was no partner, assistant, or secretary for Johnny. The character closest to a continuing role was that of Pat McCracken of the Universal Adjustment Bureau, who assigned Johnny many of his cases. Another atypical aspect gave the show additional credibility â frequently, characters on the show would mention that they had heard about Johnnyâs cases on the radio. Johnny often used his time when filling out his expense accounts to give the audience background information or to express his thoughts about the current case. No fewer than eight actors played Johnny Dollar. Dick Powell, of <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Rogues_Gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogueâs Gallery</a> fame, cut the original audition tape, but chose to do <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Richard_Diamond_Private_Detective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Diamond, Private Detective</a> instead. Gerald Mohr, of <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i> fame, auditioned in 1955, prior to Bob Bailey getting the title role. Through the first three actors to play Johnny Dollar (Charles Russell, Edmond O'Brien, and John Lund), there was little to distinguish the series from many other radio detective series. Dollar was just another hard-boiled detective in a medium that was overloaded with the stereotype. Charles Russell, the first to play the role, would throw silver dollars to bellboys and waiters. Luckily, this trite gimmick did not survive long. On October 3, 1955, after a hiatus of over a year, the show came back with a vengeance. A new production team, including director/writer Jack Johnstone, a new star, Bob Bailey, from the radio series <i>Let George Do It</i>, and a new format would set the series apart from its competitors. Johnny's cases were now a continuing serial, five days a week, for fifteen minutes each evening. With 75 minutes of airtime, minus commercials and openings and closings, there was sufficient time to develop good storylines and interesting characters. During this time, <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> attracted some of the best writers in Hollywood, including Jack Johnstone, E. Jack Neuman (using the pen name John Dawson), Robert Ryf, and Les Crutchfield. Bob Bailey also wrote a script while he was playing Johnny Dollar. He used the pen name Robert Bainter (Bainter was his middle name) as the scriptwriter for \"The Carmen Kringle Matter\", which was aired on Saturday, December 21, 1957 on the West Coast, and on the following day for the rest of the country. Bob Bailey, generally thought of as the most popular of the Johnny Dollars, brought a new interpretation to the character â tough, but not hard-boiled; streetwise, but not overly cynical, Bailey's Dollar was smart and gritty when he had to be. But Bailey's Johnny Dollar was also human. His character would get emotionally involved in a number of his cases. He had a streak of impatience, and would occasionally not fully listen to a witness and rush off on a tangent before realizing his mistake. The weekday serialized episodes are generally acknowledged as some of the finest radio detective shows ever produced. There were fifty six multi-part shows in all: fifty four five-part shows, one six-part show, and one nine-part show. The serialized episodes continued until November 2, 1956 when the series again reverted to a once a week, thirty minute format. Bob Bailey continued in the lead, until \"The Empty Threat Matter\" of November 27, 1960, when the Hollywood run ended. The guest stars and supporting casts were always first rate, attracting the best radio actors in both Los Angeles and New York. Pat McCracken was played by several actors â most frequently, by Larry Dobkin. Particularly noteworthy was the work of Virginia Gregg, who played many roles, including Johnny's girlfriend Betty Lewis. Harry Bartell was also a frequent guest, who did many of the Spanish dialect roles when Johnny went to a Latin American country. Other frequent guest performers were Parley Baer, Tony Barrett, John Dehner, Don Diamond, Sam Edwards, Herb Ellis, Frank Gerstle, Stacy Harris, Jack Kruschen, Forrest Lewis, Howard McNear, Marvin Miller, Jeanette Nolan, Vic Perrin, Barney Phillips, Jean Tatum, Russell Thomson, Ben Wright, and Will Wright. Vincent Price co-starred as himself in \"The Price of Fame Matter\" and went to Europe with Johnny on the case. In December 1960, the show moved to New York. Robert Readick started the New York run as Dollar, but only lasted a short while. Jack Johnstone continued to write for the show and submitted scripts from California. Johnstone wrote about 350 Johnny Dollar scripts under his own name and his pen names Sam Dawson and Jonathan Bundy. Johnstone wrote the last episodes of both <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> and <i>Suspense</i>. He used the Bundy pen name when writing the last <i>Suspense</i> episode, \"Devilstone\". And so, an era passed. <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> was the last continuing detective series of the Golden Age of Radio. Mandel Kramer was the last Johnny Dollar, and a close second in popularity to Bailey, when the final episode, \"The Tip-Off Matter\", was aired on September 30, 1962. <font size=\"1\">Material for this description was prepared by Stewart Wright.</font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Van Dine first published in the mid 1920s. Vance, in the original books, is an intellectual so highly refined he seems he might be ghostwritten by P. G. Wodehouse. Take this quote from <i>The Benson Murder Case</i>, 1924, as Vance pontificates in his inimitable way: \"That's your fundamental error, don't y' know. Every crime is witnessed by outsiders, just as is every work of art. The fact that no one sees the criminal, or the artist, actu'lly at work, is wholly incons'quential.\" Thankfully, the radio series uses only the name, and makes Philo a pretty normal, though very intelligent and extremely courteous gumshoe. Jose Ferrer played him in 1945. From 1948-1950, the fine radio actor Jackson Beck makes Vance as good as he gets. George Petrie plays Vance's constantly impressed public servant, District Attorney Markham. Joan Alexander is Ellen Deering, Vance's secretary and right-hand woman. The organist for the show is really working those ivories, and fans of old time radio organ will especially enjoy this series. Perhaps one reason the organist \"pulls out all the stops\" is because there seems to be little, if any, sound effects on the show. <i>Philo Vance</i>, the radio series, does pay homage to the original books in that both were, even in their own time, a bit out of date and stilted. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Philo Vance <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>April 10, 2007 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 2 <b>Number of CDs: </b>2 <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!</font></b></i></p> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Ironically, the episode was titled \"Devil Stone\" and was the last dramatic radio play from a series that had its roots in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-time_radio\" rel=\"nofollow\">golden age of radio. </a>. What began as a \"new series frankly dedicated to your horrification and entertainment\" took on a life of its own mostly due to the talents of some outstanding producers and adaptations and original stories from the cream of mystery writers of the time. The golden age of radio was truly the golden age of <i>SUSPENSE</i> as show after show broadcast outstanding plays which were \"calculated to intrigue...stir [the] nerves.\" It was the series' first producer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Spier\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Spier</a>, who set the framework of rules that was to stay with the show for most of its run. Mr. Spier determined that the series should deal with life-and-death situations established near the beginning of each play and then through the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bernard_Herrmann</a>'s musical coloring and the writer's characterizations slowly tighten the knot of <i>SUSPENSE</i>. Many of the early stories were written by the mystery writer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dickson_Carr\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Dickson Carr</a>. Others were by such fine writers as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Fletcher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Fletcher</a>, whose <i>SUSPENSE</i> play, \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry,_Wrong_Number#Radio_play\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sorry, Wrong Number</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1943/Suspense_430525_043_Sorry_Wrong_Number_128-44_28100_29m17s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/download)</a> was turned into a major motion picture; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Arthur,_Jr.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Arthur</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Richards\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert L. Richards</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton_Fine\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morton Fine</a> and David Friedkin. The series also drew from the mystery writers of the day as well as the horror writers of literature; writers such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edgar Allan Poe</a> , <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft\" rel=\"nofollow\">H.

Sayers</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells\" rel=\"nofollow\">H. G. Wells</a>. Many of the stories produced by Mr. Spier are now classics of the genre. Listen to the likes of \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_in_Cypress_Canyon\" rel=\"nofollow\">The House in Cypress Canyon</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1946/Suspense_461205_222_The_House_in_Cypress_Canyon_128-44_28764_30m20s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/downoad)</a> as a young couple encounters something in the closet of their new home, something horrible and dangerous; or \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitch-Hiker_%28radio_play%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">The_Hitch-Hiker</a> \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1942/Suspense_420902_011_The_Hitch-Hiker_128-44_29227_30m50s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">(listen/download)</a> in which a man driving cross-country seems to be haunted by an ominous figure, who keeps reappearing trying to get a ride. But what foreboding does the hitchhiker hold for the driver? Another rule William Spier established was to make the series a place to hear the talents of Hollywood's famous actors. There rarely was a famous actor who did not appear on the series at some time. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Stewart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jimmy_Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cary Grant</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Humphrey Bogart</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Ball</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olivia de Havilland</a> and many others all made at least one appearance. The series had a generous budget from its network, CBS. In 1948 the series had become popular enough that it was decided to broadcast for a complete hour, instead of the former thirty minutes. The actor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_%28actor%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Montgomery</a> was brought in to introduce the plays, replacing the \"Man in Black\" character and occasionally star in them. This format lasted only six months most probably due to the realization that the show worked best within a thirty minute framework. It was at this time that William Spier left and over the years others came to produce the shows, each setting his own unique mark. Anton M. Leader, who came from producing another horror radio program, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_at_Midnight_%28radio_series%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Murder_at_Midnight</a>, added some lighter <i>SUSPENSE</i> stories which focused more on the central characters. Jimmy Stewart appeared in an excellent story about a paralysed war veteran who thinks he has found the man who imprisoned and tortured him. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fibber McGee and Molly</a> appeared in a tale about a killer on the loose in \" <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles_By_Year_1949/Suspense_490203_326_Backseat_Driver_128-44_28499_30m03s.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backseat Driver</a>.\" Probably the biggest change in <i>SUSPENSE</i> came under the producing eye of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Lewis_%28radio%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elliott Lewis</a>. Lewis brought in comic actors to play serious roles. Actors such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Benny\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Benny</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Skelton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Skelton</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzie_Nelson\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ozzie Nelson</a>. He also was not afraid to experiment using the series slot for classic \"murder\" stories such as \" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello\" rel=\"nofollow\">Othello</a>.\" The series continued to produce high-quality drama, though there were many repeats as well as borrowing of scripts from other radio shows. While a number of film actors continued to star occasionally, many of the stars were from radio and television since radio as a dramatic art form was beginning to lose its popularity and budgets were tightened. The show was on the air for a little over twenty years beginning in January, 1942 and was rarely pre-empted. There were 947 performances. Nearly all (approximately 895) are available to collectors. When <i>SUSPENSE</i> left the air, radio was never to see the likes of such a series again. Now the great medium of radio where imagination can run free has been reduced to the occasional brilliant drama airing sporadically in some corner of the world. <i>SUSPENSE</i> was a golden moment in a golden age. A moment when the thrill of the nightime led the listener along the path of intrigue, horror and dangerous adventure.

This is the job of the guardian of the forest, Ranger Bill. Pouring rain, freezing cold, blistering heat, snows, floods, bears, rattlesnakes, mountain lions. Yes, all this in exchange for the satisfaction and pride of a job well done.\" That was the opening of Ranger Bill, a Christian radio adventure serial produced under the auspices of the Moody Broadcasting Network and the Moody Bible Institute. There were 206 episodes of Ranger Bill, which ran from 1950 to 1954 in a 15-minute format on WMBI in Chicago, and in syndication as a 30-minute show from 1954 to 1962. The series followed the adventures of Park Ranger Bill Jefferson. Miron Canaday starred as Bill, the chief forest ranger in the small Rocky Mountain town of Knotty Pine, where the former US Marine lived with his mother. Ranger Bill was your standard radio hero, a paragon of fitness and virtue who could resolve nearly any situation. Ranger Bill and his friends were faced with many situations to solve over the years, from the mundane, like finding lost kids or investigating the problems racing boats were causing on the lake, to the fantastic, including several elephant attacks, spacemen apparently coming from a meteor and trying to find a lost treasure in the Amazon, all the while stressing positive Christian values for young people. Friends that figured prominently in Bill's adventures included Stumpy Jenkins, an eagle-eyed ranger known for his marksmanship and often called \"the Old Timer\"; Henry Scott, Bill's teenage ward, was learning the ways of the woods by helping out Bill in the park, along with young ranger Ralph Carpenter; and Gray Wolf, a ranger and a member of the Dakota tribe. Gray Wolf spoke in the typical broken English for the era and genre, but knew how to use the traditional ways of his people and modern forest management methods to help Bill protect the woods. The first episode introduced Bill's boss, Colonel Anders, who sent Bill and Henry to blow up the Pine Ridge Dam in order to stop a forest fire threatening the Pendleton Valley. The program is still broadcast on the Children's Sonshine Network and on His Kids Radio, both on regional radio stations and internet simulcasts, along with several other similarly Christian-themed programs. <font size=\"-2\"></font> From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

It starred Bob Bailey as detective-for-hire George Valentine (with Olan Soule stepping into the role in 1954). Clients came to Valentine's office after reading a newspaper carrying his classified ad: <blockquote><i>Personal notice: Danger's my stock in trade. If the job's too tough for you to handle, you've got a job for me. George Valentine.</i></blockquote> The few earliest episodes were more sitcom than private eye shows, with a studio audience providing scattered laughter at the not-so-funny scripts. Soon the audience was banished, and George went from stumbling comedic hero to tough guy private eye and the music from wah-wah-wah to suspenseful. Valentine's secretary was Claire Brooks, aka Brooksie (Frances Robinson, Virginia Gregg, Lillian Buyeff). As Valentine made his rounds in search of the bad guys, he usually encountered Brooksie's kid brother, Sonny (Eddie Firestone), Lieutenant Riley (Wally Maher) and elevator man Caleb (Joseph Kearns). For the first few shows, Sonny was George's assistant, but he was soon relegated to an occasional character. Sponsored by Standard Oil, the program was broadcast on the West Cast Mutual Broadcasting System from October 18, 1946 to September 27, 1954, first on Friday evenings and then on Mondays. In its last season, transcriptions were aired in New York, Wednesdays at 9:30pm, from January 20, 1954 to January 12, 1955. John Hiestand was the program's announcer. Don Clark directed the scripts by David Victor and Jackson Gillis. The background music was supplied by Eddie Dunstedter, initially with a full orchestra. When television supplanted radio as the country's primary home entertainment, radio budgets got skimpier and skimpier and Dunstedter's orchestra was replaced by an organ. <font size=\"2\">Information from WikiPedia</font> <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">YOURS TRULY, JOHNNY DOLLAR</font></b></u></i></p> For over twelve years, from 1949 through 1962 (including a one year hiatus in 1954-1955), this series recounted the cases \"the man with the action-packed expense account, America’s fabulous freelance insurance investigator, Johnny Dollar\". Johnny was an accomplished 'padder' of his expense account. The name of the show derives from the fact that he closed each show by totaling his expense account, and signing it \"End of report... Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\". Terry Salomonson in his authoritative \"A Radio Broadcast Log of the Drama Program Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", notes that the original working title was \"Yours Truly, Lloyd London\". Salomonson writes \"Lloyd London was scratched out of the body of (the Dick Powell) audition script and Johnny Dollar was written in. Thus the show was re-titled on this script and the main character was renamed. Why this was done was unclear – possibly to prevent a legal run-in with Lloyd’s of London Insurance Company.\" Although based in Hartford, Connecticut, the insurance capital of the world, freelancer Johnny Dollar managed to get around quite a bit – his adventures taking him all over the world. There were some unusual devices used in the show that help set it apart from other shows. There was no partner, assistant, or secretary for Johnny. The character closest to a continuing role was that of Pat McCracken of the Universal Adjustment Bureau, who assigned Johnny many of his cases. Another atypical aspect gave the show additional credibility – frequently, characters on the show would mention that they had heard about Johnny’s cases on the radio. Johnny often used his time when filling out his expense accounts to give the audience background information or to express his thoughts about the current case. No fewer than eight actors played Johnny Dollar. Dick Powell, of <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Rogues_Gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogue’s Gallery</a> fame, cut the original audition tape, but chose to do <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Richard_Diamond_Private_Detective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Diamond, Private Detective</a> instead. Gerald Mohr, of <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i> fame, auditioned in 1955, prior to Bob Bailey getting the title role. Through the first three actors to play Johnny Dollar (Charles Russell, Edmond O'Brien, and John Lund), there was little to distinguish the series from many other radio detective series. Dollar was just another hard-boiled detective in a medium that was overloaded with the stereotype. Charles Russell, the first to play the role, would throw silver dollars to bellboys and waiters. Luckily, this trite gimmick did not survive long. On October 3, 1955, after a hiatus of over a year, the show came back with a vengeance. A new production team, including director/writer Jack Johnstone, a new star, Bob Bailey, from the radio series <i>Let George Do It</i>, and a new format would set the series apart from its competitors. Johnny's cases were now a continuing serial, five days a week, for fifteen minutes each evening. With 75 minutes of airtime, minus commercials and openings and closings, there was sufficient time to develop good storylines and interesting characters. During this time, <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> attracted some of the best writers in Hollywood, including Jack Johnstone, E. Jack Neuman (using the pen name John Dawson), Robert Ryf, and Les Crutchfield. Bob Bailey also wrote a script while he was playing Johnny Dollar. He used the pen name Robert Bainter (Bainter was his middle name) as the scriptwriter for \"The Carmen Kringle Matter\", which was aired on Saturday, December 21, 1957 on the West Coast, and on the following day for the rest of the country. Bob Bailey, generally thought of as the most popular of the Johnny Dollars, brought a new interpretation to the character – tough, but not hard-boiled; streetwise, but not overly cynical, Bailey's Dollar was smart and gritty when he had to be. But Bailey's Johnny Dollar was also human. His character would get emotionally involved in a number of his cases. He had a streak of impatience, and would occasionally not fully listen to a witness and rush off on a tangent before realizing his mistake. The weekday serialized episodes are generally acknowledged as some of the finest radio detective shows ever produced. There were fifty six multi-part shows in all: fifty four five-part shows, one six-part show, and one nine-part show. The serialized episodes continued until November 2, 1956 when the series again reverted to a once a week, thirty minute format. Bob Bailey continued in the lead, until \"The Empty Threat Matter\" of November 27, 1960, when the Hollywood run ended. The guest stars and supporting casts were always first rate, attracting the best radio actors in both Los Angeles and New York. Pat McCracken was played by several actors – most frequently, by Larry Dobkin. Particularly noteworthy was the work of Virginia Gregg, who played many roles, including Johnny's girlfriend Betty Lewis. Harry Bartell was also a frequent guest, who did many of the Spanish dialect roles when Johnny went to a Latin American country. Other frequent guest performers were Parley Baer, Tony Barrett, John Dehner, Don Diamond, Sam Edwards, Herb Ellis, Frank Gerstle, Stacy Harris, Jack Kruschen, Forrest Lewis, Howard McNear, Marvin Miller, Jeanette Nolan, Vic Perrin, Barney Phillips, Jean Tatum, Russell Thomson, Ben Wright, and Will Wright. Vincent Price co-starred as himself in \"The Price of Fame Matter\" and went to Europe with Johnny on the case. In December 1960, the show moved to New York. Robert Readick started the New York run as Dollar, but only lasted a short while. Jack Johnstone continued to write for the show and submitted scripts from California. Johnstone wrote about 350 Johnny Dollar scripts under his own name and his pen names Sam Dawson and Jonathan Bundy. Johnstone wrote the last episodes of both <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> and <i>Suspense</i>. He used the Bundy pen name when writing the last <i>Suspense</i> episode, \"Devilstone\". And so, an era passed. <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> was the last continuing detective series of the Golden Age of Radio. Mandel Kramer was the last Johnny Dollar, and a close second in popularity to Bailey, when the final episode, \"The Tip-Off Matter\", was aired on September 30, 1962. <font size=\"1\">Material for this description was prepared by Stewart Wright.</font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

He appeared in several short stories in the pulps and several novels. Casey, whose first name was never revealed, was the major crime photographer at the fictional Morning Express newspaper. With the help of reporter Ann Williams, he tracked down criminals and solved numerous crimes on this popular mystery-adventure series. Often a picture snapped at a crime scene led Casey to play detective. Casey and Ann often enlisted the aid their police cheif friend, Captain Logan during each week's half-hour episode. In between assighments, crime investigators Casey and Ann went to their favorite tavern, 'The Blue Note', and discussed their adventures with their bartender friend Ethelbert. There the crowd was friendly and the music was more than a backdrop. The jazz piano belonged to Herman Chittison, Matt Crowley and Staats Cotsworth played Casey, with the latter playing the role longer: Alice Reinheart, Betty Furness, Jone Allison, Lesley Woods, and Jan Miner (best remembered in the role) played Ann at different times.

The plays were assembled and rehearsed for a week, in sharp contrast to many other shows, which required a minimal of an actorâs time.

The shoes were designed for children and so sponsoring a children's radio show seemed like a good idea. In 1937, they launched a syndicated children's serial named \"Cruise of the Poll Parrot\". The show was sold in thirteen segment blocks, and three complete blocks exist today. The shows exponentially boosted shoe sales, helping International compete against the leader in children's shoes: Buster Brown. The main character for the show was a 24 year old man from St. Louis, Missouri, named Marvin Miller. This was some of his first radio work. He was the voice for the main character, Captain Roy Dalton, the Master of the ship Poll Parrot, and also the voice of the parrot that was the pet of the Captain. Marvin Miller went on to work on hundreds of other radio shows, mostly as an announcer. He acted in a number of films, most notably in 1947 starring with Humphrey Bogart in \"Dead Reckoning\". Miller played a crooked gambler's sadistic henchman named Krause. He became most famous as Michael Anthony, the man who handed out the million dollar checks in the 1950s TV series, \"The Millionaire\". Miller died in Los Angeles of a heart attack in 1984 at the age of 71. The Cruise of the Poll Parrot takes place in 1858 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, center of the United States whaling industry. Besides Captain Roy Dalton, the cast included Ezra Grange, owner of the Poll Parrot, Ezra's little sister Sue, and her friend Johnny Robbins. Other characters on the show were first mate George Wainwright, a one legged sailor named Old Dickson, a muteness crew member named Red Mahooley, ship keeper Breckenridge, and El Testi who was an agent for another shipping company.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">ESCAPE</font></b></u></i></p> In the Golden Days of Radio, back in the 1930s to the 1950s, most popular radio series had a set time for going out each week. Occasionally, there might be a change in the schedule, but on the whole a consistent time-slot was something that helped build a large audience and so was something the big networks aimed to achieve. One exception to this rule was the dramatic adventure anthology series called <i>Escape</i>, whose time-slot shifted an incredible eighteen times in its seven-year run from 1947 through to 1954. To make matters even worse it had a habit of coming and going and sometimes disappearing off the schedules altogether at short notice for weeks on end only to resurface weeks later in a completely different timeslot. The quite flagrant disregard CBS paid to having a regular timeslot for <i>Escape</i> could make you think that it was just a run-of-the-mill series that was nothing but a lightweight filler for those times when the regular show was off-the-air, such as during the quiet summer months. In my opinion, and that of many old radio aficionados, this couldn't be further from the truth. <i>Escape</i> is probably the best adventure anthology ever broadcast. <i>Escape</i> brings together everything that was good about old-time radio drama rolled into one. The title itself almost sums up the very essence of what radio drama is all about. Each of the episodes was a micro drama carefully planned to capture the listeners attention for thirty minutes. Over two-hundred episodes were made and almost all of them are as good today as they were over half a century ago. For the first few years the series was on air the announcement at the start of the show varied almost every week, but by the 1950s it had settled down to be the now famous: <blockquote>Tired of the everyday grind? Ever dream of a life of romantic adventure? Want to get away from it all? We offer you ... ESCAPE!</blockquote> This may give the wrong impression as <i>Escape</i> was far more than a swashbuckling adventure yarn. It was a brilliantly scripted and superbly produced series that brought to listeners adaptations of classic works by famous writers as well as brand new work by unknown talent. Many of the stories were later reused by more high profile shows such as <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Suspense\" rel=\"nofollow\">Suspense</a>, but on the whole the <i>Escape</i> versions were of equal quality and sometimes more dramatically focused and atmospheric. When <i>Radio Life</i> wrote \"These stories all possess many times the reality that most radio writing conveys\", it hit the nail on the head. This is a quality show in every way. If you've never listened to this wonderful series it's well worth taking the time to listen to it. Whether you listen in the car on your daily commute, whilst doing the housework, relaxing in your favorite easy-chair, or snuggled up in bed - you really will be thrilled! <font size=\"-2\">This Article courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.educations4u.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.educations4u.com</a>.</font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Escape <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>November 27, 2011 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>11 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

This show introduces itself succinctly: \"A series of true crime stories from the records and newspapers of every land, from every time. Your host each week, is Mr. Thomas Hyland -- connoisseur of crime, student of violence, and teller of murders. \" Thomas Hyland is played by Lou Merrill, although you'd never know it was an \"actor\" doing the part. The great Elliott Lewis, actor, producer and director of Suspense, Broadway is my Beat and On Stage is in charge of this very intelligent and enjoyable show. Composer Bernard Herrmann duplicated authentic music of the era being dramatized, and Morton Fine and David Friedkin were the writers. Lewis and his writers collected and developed true crime stories expressly for <i>Crime Classics</i>. Thomas Hyland's delivery is measured and mild-mannered, as if giving a college lecture. Would that all professors were this interesting! The actors in the stories themselves are uniformly. Sensitive orchestral scores by the great Bernard Hermann, who did Orson Welles' <i>Mercury Theater</i> radio show and then Alfred Hitchcock's films, give the stories sophistication and mood. So do the tasteful sound effects. There is a wry, cool-blooded tone to the proceedings. Cases ranged from seventeenth-century murder to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Each and every story, however bizarre, is actually based on fact. For example, the show on the Younger Brothers of the American West has some very interesting background details concerning Quantrell's Raiders and the Kansas Jayhawks. In the story of \"John Hayes, his Head, and How They Were Parted,\" we hear the tale of a glassblower who blows glass perfectly and completely surrounding the severed head of a unknown deadman. Then it is placed in a museum where it remained pending identification. Thus his killers were found out by the dead man, using his head. This show is a good companion to other old time radio shows that are historically-oriented, such as <i>Cavalcade of America</i>, <i>You Are There</i>, and <i>American Trail</i>. For science and research, the shows <i>Science Magazine of the Air</i> and <i>Adventures in Research</i> are very good. <font size=\"1\">Information for this description came from John Dunning's \"Tune In Yesterday The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio\".</font> <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

Although hewing to a strict story line, the show neverless also was able to supply considerable descriptive color to the manner of life in those days. For example, the listerner may learn of the customs by which the master of the house is waited upon by his wife at all meals and that she and the rest of the family may not partake until the head of the rancho has finished. The commercials, too, proceeded along similar lines, recollecting that in the period being dramatized there were but a few parcels of land and those were of tremendous size, owned by wealthy individuals. Now there are over 2,000,000 seperate parcels of land in Los Angeles County alone. The program was well written and the historical material adds nicely to the flavor.

All episodes are available. It starred Michael Dunn as Dr. Danfield, with JoAnne Johnson as Rusty Fairfax, his secretary. The series was written by Ralph Wilkinson and produced by Wally Ramsey. This series consistently featured some of the worst acting and writing of any detective show to reach the airwaves. The show had a formula with the crime usually being committed in the first third of the program, the good doctor solving it in the second third, and then pedantically explaining the solution to someone (usually his \"pretty, young\" secretary, Rusty) in the conclusion. Dr. Daniel Danfield was an obnoxious unlicensed private investigator/criminal psychologist with an ego complex. Why Rusty would put up with this guy is beyond understanding. In this case, love is not only blind, but also deaf and dumb. But then, Rusty was no prize package either. In fact, the most complex person on the show is Dr. Dan Danfield's pretty young secretary, Miss Rusty Fairfax. Why does Dr. Dan always call her Miss Fairfax? Dr. Dan goes to extremes to keep her at arm's length, but it's obvious he's just taunting her. After all, he's a criminal psychologist, and the way he treats Rusty is criminal! She can flare up, but usually just slow simmers in her professionally feminine way. Too bad one of the bad guys wasn't able to rub both of them out but these crooks were incredibly inept. Unfortunately, the toughs, society-types in trouble and the necessary law enforcement officers in this series, are nearly as individual as furniture in a model home. Still, if mindless detective drama is what you're looking for and you've tried the rest, then let Dr. Dan Danfield give you a little of a criminal psychologist's caseload. The show makes good drive-time or casual listening, since it doesn't make great demands on the emotions or intellect. From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Ironically, the episode was titled \"Devil Stone\" and was the last dramatic radio play from a series that had its roots in the golden age of radio. What began as a \"new series frankly dedicated to your horrification and entertainment\" took on a life of its own mostly due to the talents of some outstanding producers and adaptations and original stories from the cream of mystery writers of the time. The golden age of radio was truly the golden age of <i>SUSPENSE</i> as show after show broadcast outstanding plays which were \"calculated to intrigue...stir [the] nerves.\" It was the series' first producer, William Spier, who set the framework of rules that was to stay with the show for most of its run. Mr. Spier determined that the series should deal with life-and-death situations established near the beginning of each play and then through the use of Bernard Herrmann's musical coloring and the writer's characterizations slowly tighten the knot of <i>SUSPENSE</i>. Many of the early stories were written by the mystery writer, John Dickson Carr. Others were by such fine writers as Lucille Fletcher, whose <i>SUSPENSE</i> play, \"Sorry, Wrong Number\" was turned into a major motion picture; Robert Arthur, Robert L. Richards, Morton Fine and David Friedkin. The series also drew from the mystery writers of the day as well as the horror writers of literature; writers such as Edgar Allen Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, Cornell Woolrich, Dorthy L. Sayers and H.G. Wells. Many of the stories produced by Mr. Spier are now classics of the genre. Listen to the likes of \"The House in Cypress Canyon\" as a young couple encounters something in the closet of their new home, something horrible and dangerous; or \"The Hitchhiker\" in which a man driving cross-country seems to be haunted by an ominous figure, who keeps reappearing trying to get a ride. But what foreboding does the hitchhiker hold for the driver? Another rule William Spier established was to make the series a place to hear the talents of Hollywood's famous actors. There rarely was a famous actor who did not appear on the series at some time. Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, Lucille Ball, Olivia De Havilland and many others all made at least one appearance. The series had a generous budget from its network, CBS. In 1948 the series had become popular enough that it was decided to broadcast for a complete hour, instead of the former thirty minutes. The actor Robert Montgomery was brought in to introduce the plays, replacing the \"Man in Black\" character and occasionally star in them. This format lasted only six months most probably due to the realization that the show worked best within a thirty minute framework. It was at this time that William Spier left and over the years others came to produce the shows, each setting his own unique mark. Anton M. Leader, who came from producing another horror radio program, MURDER AT MIDNIGHT, added some lighter <i>SUSPENSE</i> stories which focused more on the central characters. Jimmy Stewart appeared in an excellent story about a paralysed war veteran who thinks he has found the man who imprisoned and tortured him. Fibber McGee & Molly appeared in a tale about a killer on the loose in \"Backseat Driver.\" Probably the biggest change in <i>SUSPENSE</i> came under the producing eye of Elliott Lewis. Lewis brought in comic actors to play serious roles. Actors such as Jack Benny, Red Skelton and Ozzie Nelson. He also was not afraid to experiment using the series slot for classic \"murder\" stories such as \"Othello.\" The series continued to produce high-quality drama, though there were many repeats as well as borrowing of scripts from other radio shows. While a number of film actors continued to star occasionally, many of the stars were from radio and television since radio as a dramatic art form was beginning to lose its popularity and budgets were tightened. The show was on the air for a little over twenty years beginning in January, 1942 and was rarely pre-empted. There were 947 performances. Nearly all (approximately 895) are available to collectors. When <i>SUSPENSE</i> left the air, radio was never to see the likes of such a series again. Now the great medium of radio where imagination can run free has been reduced to the occasional brilliant drama airing sporadically in some corner of the world. <i>SUSPENSE</i> was a golden moment in a golden age. A moment when the thrill of the nightime led the listener along the path of intrigue, horror and dangerous adventure.

The listeners of <i>The World Adventerer’s Club</i> and other travelogue series in this early part of radio’s Golden Age were offered glimpses of exotic places and extraordinary events without leaving their own front room. The renewed interest in far off lands and cultures was, at least in part, also a reflection of the political situation. Many nations during this time were expanding their influence around the globe establishing colonies and outposts. You can still hear a faint echo of this influence in the stories -- some of the episodes carry a decidedly “colonial” attitude toward the native inhabitants of these countries … who are sometimes characterized in a manner that, by today’s standards, would be offensive. The setting for the series is a well-to-do gentleman’s club of the type that flourished in the 1890’s from Europe to the US. There’s even an all male chorus on hand, common to those establishments, which each week extols the virtues of living on the edge where adventures, discoveries, and the real threat of death are constant companions Using the cigar-smoky, brandy in hand, parlor as a backdrop, each episode takes the form of a report being told to the other members of the club by someone who’s just returned from some adventure in a far away, mysterious place. Members in the radio audience need only sit back in their chair, close their eyes, and imagine that they, too, are basking in the camaraderie of the club – as they share their experiences. Sadly, nothing is known about any of the regular cast members of this show. We do know that Hanley Stafford was the featured story teller in at least six of the episodes. Hanley Stafford, who was born on September 22, 1889 as Alfred John Austin, took his stage name from his birthplace of Hanley, Staffordshire in England. No stranger to US radio his was the voice of “Daddy” for “Baby Snooks” and “Dithers” in the “Blondie” radio program. He died of a heart attack just a couple weeks before his 79th birthday on September 11 1968. The series was transcribed by a California company named Transco. Of course, one of the benefits of transcription is that all 32 of the 15-minute episodes produced are still available for us to enjoy today. A tribute to the enduring nature of this series, it should be mentioned that much later, from January 1947 to January 1948, another series borrowed it’s format for a set of 30-minute episodes under the simplified name <i>The Adventurer’s Club</i>. And now, find a deep wingback chair, lean back, and prepare to enter a time when most of the world was truly unknown and any exploration revealed wonders, opportunities and dangers. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>World Adventurer's Club <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>August 15, 2006 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Jungles and deserts made up the eerie background sounds of the series that featured Don Douglas as John Steele. John Steele was the type of roving adventurer and thrill seeker who held various jobs in exotic locations. Among his career paths were country sheriff, special agent in Turkey and a ship's captain. The stories were narrated by a friend of Steele's, with Steele making cameo appearances throughout. Ted Mallie, of <i>The Shadow</i> and <i>I Love a Mystery</i> announcing fame also landed the job of the announcer for <i>John Steele, Adventurer</i>, which featured Elliot Drake as the director. John Larkin, Jack Edwards, Bryna Raeburn and other radio personalities were also featured in the series as supporting actors. Music for the series added tones of mystery and adventure and was produced by Sylvan Levin and later, Doc Whipple. Fans of the <i>John Steele, Adventurer</i> enjoyed the hard and fast-paced action and the stories seemed to be lifted off the pages from popular action magazines of the time such as All-Story and Argosy. To overcome the challenges of a radio show featuring a person who couldn't speak, the producers represented the boy's thoughts (rather than speaking voice) by using an echo chamber. It was considered a very moving and adventurous story of the series.

This OTRR Collection is a Non-Certified one, containing series in which currently only one or two episodes are known to exist -- hence the name: \"Singles and Doubles Collection\". Almost every type genre is included. Radio -- called by some <i>The Theater of the Mind</i> -- has been with us since 1920 when stations WWJ of Detroit and KDKA of Pittsburg made the first regular commercial broadcasts. The first program aimed at entertaining the unseen audience followed close behind. Over the years since then, literally thousands of series have been broadcast nationally and thousands more in regional or local markets. Some endured for a few years, others for 20 or 30, and some unfortunately only had one episode broadcast. Of those thousands, some series saw some of their episodes saved for the future, some saw nearly all and others only one or two episodes. While the goal of the Old Time Radio Researchers Group is to preserve radios past by collecting, and archiving as many different series as possible and making them available to the community, we do not want to let the series that only had a minimum number of episodes to survive go unpreserved for future generations. To that end we have put together this unique collection of series. Most of the programs you will find here will be totally unfamilar to you, but they are informative and entertaining none the less. This is the second version of this collection that we have released. Since the first collection new broadcasts have surfaced, and others will undoubtely be found in the future. When and if that occurs, we will release a version three. From comedy to drama to cooking shows to music, you'll hear it all here, and every episode will be unique and different. They run the gamut, from the middle 20s to the early 70s, all showing us a glimpse of the past, when things were slower and families gathered round the radio each evening. Times when each person was hearing the same thing, but created a different picture in their minds of what the characters looked like, the scenery, location, and most important the sounds. Sounds that each found a different meaning in, but one that entertained, educated, and made the world a smaller place, where you could hear those stories that in the past were told to just a few, gathered round the dinner table, at a campfire, or in small audiences, but now the whole world could hear and enjoy. Some of these episodes may be misnamed or misdated. If you find such, please let us know. Additionally there may be some dead air space at the beginning or ending of some episodes. This is not one of our certified sets, it is being provided as a way to obtain those series in which only one or two shows have survived.

All 86 episodes survive today. The series aired from 27 Jan 1956 until 22 Sep 1957, of course on CBS. The original idea for the show came from Irving Reis back in the thirties. What he wanted was an experimental workshop, a sustaining program where actors, writers and technicians could produce scripts the sponsors might be afraid to try. The time was right in the late fifties to try this concept again, however, under different circumstances. By this time television was taking the big money so why not try this concept again since most of the big sponsors were already transitioning over. William Froug, a CBS vice president was the force behind this revival. He grew up with the old <i>Columbia Workshop</i> and pitched the idea to Howard Barnes. Howard agreed with the idea and William Froug chose Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" as the first program. Aldous Huxley narrated and William Conrad announced this radio adaptation of \"Brave New World\". The series brought together the cutting edges of writing, music, and sound. Overall it was a big hit with radio personnel and listeners. So much so that the east coast wanted in too. Thus the series alternated between the west and east coast production centers. Why not spare a little time and give a listen to some outstanding radio drama. Take the challenge and compare the <i>CBS Radio Workshop</i> with the original, <i>Columbia Workshop</i>. You decide for yourself which series is better.

An audition show was done on August 23, 1950. Harold Peary was the creator and main performer for the show. Previously starring on <i>The Great Gildersleeve</i>, Peary took many of Gildy's characteristics along with him to his new Honest Harold character... the \"dirty\" laugh, singing songs, and closing dialogue over credits were all there with Harold. And that voice. Who could forget that voice? In simple terms, Peary couldn't or wouldn't sound and act differently enough to make listeners forget Gildy, and that made it very tough for the new show to fly. Perhaps the plot was a little creaky for the beginning of the Rock 'n' Roll era, as well. The show was about an older, unmarried guy, Honest Harold Hemp, who lived with his mother and nephew and did a radio homemaker's program. The townsfolk think of him as somewhat of a celebrity, but his girlfriend, Gloria, who works at the station, knows better. The series received undeserved negative ratings and general negative comments as there were just too many similarities between the two series. Also, the series was without a sponsor, although some of the last shows were sponsored by the US Armed Forces. The series lasted only one season. The regular cast consisted of Harold Peary, Gloria Holiday, Peary’s wife, who played Gloria, Joseph Kearns as Old Doc ‘Yak Yak’ Yancy, Mary Jane Croft and Parley Baer. The announcer was Bob Lamond. The series was directed by Norman MacDonnell. Writers for the series were Harold Peary, Bill Danch, Jack Robinson and Gene Stone. Music was by Jack Meakin. The last show aired on June 13, 1951. The director of the show was Norm MacDonnell, who went on to create perhaps the greatest old time radio show - <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Gunsmoke\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gunsmoke</a>, and another western, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Fort_Laramie\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fort Laramie</a>. Of course, Norm was a sold radio veteran who certainly had a flare for directing comedy, so he and Peary, together with an excellent cast, made The Harold Peary Show just about as good a show as it could be. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>The Harold Peary Show <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>February 22, 2009 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">MOLLE MYSTERY THEATER</font></b></u></i></p> NBC's <i>Mystery Theatre</i> began airing with much fanfare on September 7, 1943. The series promised stories from the greatest classical and contemporary mystery authors -- and production values to match. And it kept its promise. It was aided from the outset by the addition of an 'annotator'-- as it was described in the 1940s --named Geoffrey Barnes. The annotator served in the role of expositor, filling in on the plot development as necessary and providing a back-story when needed. The apparent distinction made between a narrator and an annotator, was a matter of degree. Mr. Barnes, a distinguished and celebrated amateur criminologist in his own right, was apparently on hand to help the listener analyze and understand the various mysteries and their underlying crimes within each script. The program appears to have aired sustained for its first three months, with three to five sponsors beginning to make an appearance with Program #17, \"The Mystery of The Seven Keys\" of December 28, 1943. There is a circulating program titled \"Homicide for Hannah\", that should have been the first <i>Molle Mystery Theatre</i>, but there is no provenance anywhere that the initial program ever actually aired. This is the first circulating program in which we hear the program refer to itself as <i>Molle Mystery Theatre</i>. But throughout its NBC run, we hear sponsorship by Ironized Yeast, Energene, Bayer Aspirin, Sterling Drug, and Molle. To its everlasting credit, NBC clearly went to great lengths to promote the script titles, performers and authors of each program to the nation's newpapers. From 1943 through 1948, <i>Mystery Theatre</i> was one of the most well documented and promoted radio programs of its time. Indeed, so many details were available for its entire NBC run that this was one of the easiest logs we've developed in some time. We have solid, highly detailed newspaper listing provenances for almost ninety percent of the first 237 programs. Sadly, the transition from NBC to CBS didn't fare as well for <i>Mystery Theatre</i>. NBC and CBS were waging a major war at the time, each network nakedly poaching the other's greatest Radio talent and programs, wholesale. But judging from the way NBC and CBS -- and Frank and Anne Hummert -- promoted and supported their respective line-ups, it's clear that CBS was dropping the ball for the greater part of 1949. Frank and Anne Hummert were legendary talents in the area of producing and promoting melodrama. Indeed, an extraordinary number of the serial melodramas of the era were produced and developed by The Hummerts. But <i>Mystery Theatre</i> wasn't a melodrama genre -- or format. That didn't stop the Hummerts from turning it into a melodrama under their watch. The franchise declined in popular and critical favor from that point forward. In all, <i>Mystery Theatre</i> in its various incarnations ran almost continuously from the Fall line-up of 1943 well into 1952 -- an impressive nine year run in its various guises. It ran four years over NBC, three years over CBS and two years over ABC. For NBC the program aired as either <i>Mystery Theatre</i> or <i>Molle Mystery Theatre</i>. Over CBS, the program aired as <i>[Frank and Anne Hummert's] Mystery Theatre</i> and <i>Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i>. And finally, over ABC, the program aired as <i>Inspector Mark Saber of The Homicide Squad</i> or <i>Mark Saber Mysteries</i>. CBS and the Hummerts began rolling out spot ads and teaser articles about the Inspector Hearthstone programs in the Fall of 1949 but by the end of the 1951 run of Mystery Theatre the spot ads dwindled. Despite the more lackluster, melodramatic scripts, the Hummerts, relying on Alfred Shirley's celebrity and reputation, actively promoted the Inspector Hearthstone programming with their usual relentless and efficient skill--when it suited them. Apparently the reviewers of the era weren't very impressed by The Hummerts' scripts or cast. <i>Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i> held some promise to breathe new life into the franchise with distinguished actor Alfred Shirley (of Sherlock Holmes fame) in the role of Inspector Hearthstone. Inspector Hearthstone was first introduced in February and March episodes of CBS's 1949 <i>Mystery Theatre</i> run. From 1949 to the Fall of 1951, Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad appeared in all but a few of the remaining <i>Mystery Theatre</i> programs, until CBS simply changed the production name to <i>Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i> on August 30, 1951. One can only surmise CBS' rationale for preserving the name <i>Mystery Theatre</i> while producing only Inspector Hearthstone programs for almost two years. It would seem as if Frank Hummert was more comfortable working with a single protagonist for his programs, hence his almost universal focus on Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad as the central figure in almost all of the CBS <i>Mystery Theatre</i> programs from 1948-1951. One of CBS <i>Mystery Theatre's</i> most redeeming elements -- annotator Geoffrey Barnes -- was eliminated with the solo Hearthstone of The Death Squad that followed. The Hummerts chose, instead, to go with a melodramatic intro to each program more reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Challenge_of_the_Yukon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Challenge of the Yukon</a> or <i>The Lone Ranger</i>, than the CBS <i>Mystery Theatre</i> format of the previous two years. Indeed, by 1952, <i>Hearthstone of the Death Squad</i> was being heard virtually every day of the week -- somewhere, usually in repeats. CBS had apparently abandoned any further promotion of the series. Throughout most of 1952, Hearthstone of the Death Squad was in total disarray. As it was, <i>Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i> finally left the airwaves December 31, 1952 -- for the most part in repeats in various small outlets and at varying days and times. By the beginning of <i>Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i> in 1951, Television had already taken root. To further complicate the Radio and Television choices, a competing Mystery Theater from ABC aired on October 3, 1951 running in parallel with both CBS <i>Mystery Theatre's Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i> and <i>ABC's Mystery Theater</i> featuring Inspector Mark Saber of the Homicide Squad. If the intent was to confuse, both programs succeeded, and both came in for tepid reviews -- at best. In addition there were parallel Television programs titled both <i>Mystery Theater</i> and <i>Homicide Squad</i>. It's apparent that Radio and Television programmers had finally taken off the gloves in earnest. In the final analysis, the <i>Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i> run from 1951-1952 appears to have been nothing more than thriteen or so original Hearthstone programs intermixed with a year's worth of repeats of CBS <i>Mystery Theatre</i> programs. There is no direct connection whatsoever between the lineage of the various NBC and CBS <i>Mystery Theatre</i> incarnations of <i>Mystery Theatre</i> and ABC's completely different and separate <i>Mystery Theater</i>; the network, sponsor, cast, technicians and recurring characters were all completely different. However, it may be useful to describe the essential details of ABC's <i>Mystery Theater</i> to dispel any lingering ambiguities as to its lineage. ABC <i>Mystery Theater</i> [not Theatre] ran from October 3, 1951 to July 1, 1953. It's initial run of 37 episodes starred Robert Carroll as Inspector Mark Saber. It broke for the Summer of 1953 on June 11, then resumed on October 8, 1952 with a different cast. Veteran Radio actor Les Damon became Inspector Mark Saber and Walter Burke became Saber's right hand, Sergeant Tim Maloney. Clearly positioning itself in direct competition with CBS' <i>Inspector Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i>, ABC's rendition of the genre was more grounded in American big city homicide. Its production values were somewhat better than the deteriorating scripts and engineering of <i>Hearthstone of The Death Squad</i>, but both series were somewhat lackluster compared to their Television competition. And neither series ever captured the superb writing, voice talent, engineering and production values of NBC's <i>Mystery Theatre</i> series. <font size=\"-2\">From <a href=\"http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Molle-Mystery-Theatre.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Digital Deli Too</a>.</font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Molle Mystery Theater <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>February 3, 2013 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>3 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

Johnny was an accomplished 'padder' of his expense account. The name of the show derives from the fact that he closed each show by totaling his expense account, and signing it \"End of report... Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\". Terry Salomonson in his authoritative \"A Radio Broadcast Log of the Drama Program Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", notes that the original working title was \"Yours Truly, Lloyd London\". Salomonson writes \"Lloyd London was scratched out of the body of (the Dick Powell) audition script and Johnny Dollar was written in. Thus the show was re-titled on this script and the main character was renamed. Why this was done was unclear â possibly to prevent a legal run-in with Lloydâs of London Insurance Company.\" Although based in Hartford, Connecticut, the insurance capital of the world, freelancer Johnny Dollar managed to get around quite a bit â his adventures taking him all over the world. There were some unusual devices used in the show that help set it apart from other shows. There was no partner, assistant, or secretary for Johnny. The character closest to a continuing role was that of Pat McCracken of the Universal Adjustment Bureau, who assigned Johnny many of his cases. Another atypical aspect gave the show additional credibility â frequently, characters on the show would mention that they had heard about Johnnyâs cases on the radio. Johnny often used his time when filling out his expense accounts to give the audience background information or to express his thoughts about the current case. No fewer than eight actors played Johnny Dollar. Dick Powell, of <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Rogues_Gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogueâs Gallery</a> fame, cut the original audition tape, but chose to do <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Richard_Diamond_Private_Detective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Diamond, Private Detective</a> instead. Gerald Mohr, of <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i> fame, auditioned in 1955, prior to Bob Bailey getting the title role. Through the first three actors to play Johnny Dollar (Charles Russell, Edmond O'Brien, and John Lund), there was little to distinguish the series from many other radio detective series. Dollar was just another hard-boiled detective in a medium that was overloaded with the stereotype. Charles Russell, the first to play the role, would throw silver dollars to bellboys and waiters. Luckily, this trite gimmick did not survive long. On October 3, 1955, after a hiatus of over a year, the show came back with a vengeance. A new production team, including director/writer Jack Johnstone, a new star, Bob Bailey, from the radio series <i>Let George Do It</i>, and a new format would set the series apart from its competitors. Johnny's cases were now a continuing serial, five days a week, for fifteen minutes each evening. With 75 minutes of airtime, minus commercials and openings and closings, there was sufficient time to develop good storylines and interesting characters. During this time, <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> attracted some of the best writers in Hollywood, including Jack Johnstone, E. Jack Neuman (using the pen name John Dawson), Robert Ryf, and Les Crutchfield. Bob Bailey also wrote a script while he was playing Johnny Dollar. He used the pen name Robert Bainter (Bainter was his middle name) as the scriptwriter for \"The Carmen Kringle Matter\", which was aired on Saturday, December 21, 1957 on the West Coast, and on the following day for the rest of the country. Bob Bailey, generally thought of as the most popular of the Johnny Dollars, brought a new interpretation to the character â tough, but not hard-boiled; streetwise, but not overly cynical, Bailey's Dollar was smart and gritty when he had to be. But Bailey's Johnny Dollar was also human. His character would get emotionally involved in a number of his cases. He had a streak of impatience, and would occasionally not fully listen to a witness and rush off on a tangent before realizing his mistake. The weekday serialized episodes are generally acknowledged as some of the finest radio detective shows ever produced. There were fifty six multi-part shows in all: fifty four five-part shows, one six-part show, and one nine-part show. The serialized episodes continued until November 2, 1956 when the series again reverted to a once a week, thirty minute format. Bob Bailey continued in the lead, until \"The Empty Threat Matter\" of November 27, 1960, when the Hollywood run ended. The guest stars and supporting casts were always first rate, attracting the best radio actors in both Los Angeles and New York. Pat McCracken was played by several actors â most frequently, by Larry Dobkin. Particularly noteworthy was the work of Virginia Gregg, who played many roles, including Johnny's girlfriend Betty Lewis. Harry Bartell was also a frequent guest, who did many of the Spanish dialect roles when Johnny went to a Latin American country. Other frequent guest performers were Parley Baer, Tony Barrett, John Dehner, Don Diamond, Sam Edwards, Herb Ellis, Frank Gerstle, Stacy Harris, Jack Kruschen, Forrest Lewis, Howard McNear, Marvin Miller, Jeanette Nolan, Vic Perrin, Barney Phillips, Jean Tatum, Russell Thomson, Ben Wright, and Will Wright. Vincent Price co-starred as himself in \"The Price of Fame Matter\" and went to Europe with Johnny on the case. In December 1960, the show moved to New York. Robert Readick started the New York run as Dollar, but only lasted a short while. Jack Johnstone continued to write for the show and submitted scripts from California. Johnstone wrote about 350 Johnny Dollar scripts under his own name and his pen names Sam Dawson and Jonathan Bundy. Johnstone wrote the last episodes of both <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> and <i>Suspense</i>. He used the Bundy pen name when writing the last <i>Suspense</i> episode, \"Devilstone\". And so, an era passed. <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i> was the last continuing detective series of the Golden Age of Radio. Mandel Kramer was the last Johnny Dollar, and a close second in popularity to Bailey, when the final episode, \"The Tip-Off Matter\", was aired on September 30, 1962. <font size=\"1\">Material for this description was prepared by Stewart Wright.</font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

All 86 episodes survive today. The series aired from 27 Jan 1956 until 22 Sep 1957, of course on CBS. The original idea for the show came from Irving Reis back in the thirties. What he wanted was an experimental workshop, a sustaining program where actors, writers and technicians could produce scripts the sponsors might be afraid to try. The time was right in the late fifties to try this concept again, however, under different circumstances. By this time television was taking the big money so why not try this concept again since most of the big sponsors were already transitioning over. William Froug, a CBS vice president was the force behind this revival. He grew up with the old <i>Columbia Workshop</i> and pitched the idea to Howard Barnes. Howard agreed with the idea and William Froug chose Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" as the first program. Aldous Huxley narrated and William Conrad announced this radio adaptation of \"Brave New World\". The series brought together the cutting edges of writing, music, and sound. Overall it was a big hit with radio personnel and listeners. So much so that the east coast wanted in too. Thus the series alternated between the west and east coast production centers. Why not spare a little time and give a listen to some outstanding radio drama. Take the challenge and compare the <i>CBS Radio Workshop</i> with the original, <i>Columbia Workshop</i>. You decide for yourself which series is better. This is the <i>CBS Radio Workshop</i>, dedicated to man's imagination, the theater of the mind. <font size=\"-2\"></font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Powell played private detective Richard Rogue, who trailed luscious blondes, protected witness, and did whatever else detectives do to make a living. It was a good series, though not destined to make much of a mark. Under the capable direction of Dee Englebach and accompanied by the music of Leith Stevens, Powell floated through his lines with the help of such competents as Lou Merrill, Gerald Mohr, Gloria Blondell, Tony Barrett, and Lurene Tuttle. Peter Leeds played Rogue's friend Eugor, an obscure play on names with Eugor spelling Rogue backwards. The gimmick in <i>Rogue's Gallery</i> was the presence of an alter ego, \"Eugor,\" who arrived in the middle of the show to give Rogue enough information for his final deduction. Eugor was a state of mind, achieved when Rogue was knocked unconcious. Eugor would appear cackling like the host of <i>Hermit's Cave</i> and imparted some vital information the hero had overlooked. Rogue would then awaken with a vague idea of what to do next. <i>Rogue's Gallery</i> also starred different actors as Rogue, in later incarnations of the series, but Richard Powell was the most popular. This series preceded Richard Powell's most famous series, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Richard_Diamond_Private_Detective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Diamond, Private Detective</a>. Rogue trailed lovely blondes and protected witnesses in the new tough guy persona of Dick Powell. This was the transition series for Powell in his quest to be recognized as an actor rather than a singer. It had some of the same cute elements that would make <i>Richard Diamond</i> a high spot four years later. During the summer of 1946, the show was billed as <i>Bandwagon Mysteries</i>, with a tip of the hat to the sponsor. In the summer of 1947, it was again revived on NBC Sundays for Fitch, with Barry Sullivan in the title role. In 1950 the character again turned up in a two-year sustainer on the ABC Wednesday-night schedule. Chester Morris played the lead. Chester Morris was the original <i>Boston Blackie</i>. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Rogue's Gallery <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>January 14, 2011 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 4 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

He was named Børge Rosenbaum, and his musical talent was no surprise as his father was a musician in the Royal Danish Chapel. He was educated at the Royal Danish Academy of Music by Olivo Krause, and later by Victor Schiøler, Frederic Lamond and Egon Petri. He had his piano debut in 1926 at \"Odd Fellow Palæet\" in Copenhagen and was recognized as a very talented musician. During the 1930's he became one of Denmark's most popular artists. He started his career as a classical pianist, but his talent for making the audience laugh was soon obvious, and he started developing his unique blend of humor and music. He had his revue debut in 1933 and his film debut in 1937. In 1940 he was forced to leave Denmark, and he traveled from Petsano to New York. Although he didn't speak English he soon managed to \"translate\" his humor, and he performed for the first time in Bing Crosby's radio show in 1941. In 1942 he was pronounced \"the best new radio performer of the year\" by the American press, and his radio and TV shows became extremely popular. He became an American citizen in 1948, and had his own show, \"Comedy in Music\", at The Golden Theatre, New York 1953-56. He had performed as soloist and conductor with leading orchestras from 1956, and has performed as Opera Conductor, e.g. Magic Flute, Cleveland Orchestra, 1979 and The Royal Danish Theatre, 1992. He established several trusts, and he received numerous honorable awards and honors. He was the patron of The Danish Royal Academy of Music Children’s Choir. With Robert Sherman he was the author of My Favorite Intermissions (1971) and My Favorite Comedies in Music (1981). Victor Borge died at home in his sleep, December 23rd, 2000. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>The Victor Borge Collection <b>Certification Status: </b>NON CERTIFIED <b>Certification Date: </b>October 7, 2007 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 2 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

In short, audiences were dwindling. To combat the problem, NBC spent lots of money to produce <i>The Big Show</i>, a 90 minute radio program which would feature famous guests performing skits, songs, and comedic routines. Tallulah Bankhead was asked to host the show. She had guested in various radio programs in the past but had never done anything on an ongoing basis before. She was nervous and didn't really know what to expect or what her duty actually was so she approached the show with guarded anticipation. <i>The Big Show</i> premiered on November 5, 1950 and played every Sunday night for the next three years. It was a rousing success and Tallulah was a great success. The guest list varied but included such names as Ethel Merman, Danny Thomas, Fanny Brice, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Clifton Webb, Gloria Swanson, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Holliday, Ethel Barrymore, Jimmy Durante, Milton Berle, Josephine Baker, Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh, George Sanders, Yul Brynner, Shirley Booth, Peggy Lee, Rosalind Russell and Merv Griffin. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

Between March 18 and September 9, 1945, the melodramatic anthology series was broadcast on Sundays from 10:30pm to 11:00pm. Each week, after \"the sound of the great gong,\" host Philip Clarke observed that the mysteriously silent \"keeper of the book has opened the ponderous door to the secret vault wherein is kept the great sealed book, in which is recorded all the secrets and mysteries of mankind through the ages, Here are tales of every kind, tales of murder, of madness, of dark deeds strange and terrible beyond all belief.\" After this introduction, the dramas began, occasionally interrupted by curiously extended organ solos. Although this anthology series did not have recurring characters (other than the Narrator and the Keeper of the Book), the writers often used the same names for different characters from week to week, including \"Hester,\" \"Drake,\" and most especially \"Roger.\" At the end of an episode, Clarke told listeners to tune in the following week when \"the sound of the great gong heralds another strange and exciting tale from... the sealed book.\" Scripts were by Robert Arthur, Jr. and David Kogan, who also were responsible for The Mysterious Traveler, and recycled many of the more popular stories from that parent program. \"The Hands of Death\" was the first of the 26 episodes which concluded with \"Death Laughs Last.\" <font size=\"-2\">Information from WikiPedia</font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>The Sealed Book <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>October 4, 2010 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>2 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

This series didnât last long and starred Santos Ortega as Wolfe and Luis Van Rooten as Archie. The second series was during 1945 on the Mutual network in <i>The Amazing Nero Wolfe</i>. This lasted only until December 15, 1946 and starred Francis X. Bushman and Elliot Lewis as Archie. The third series was known as <i>The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe</i>. Starting on October 20, 1950 it lasted only until April 27, 1951. It starred Sidney Greenstreet as Nero Wolfe. The part of Archie was played by Lawrence Dobkin for the first twelve shows. Gerald Mohr took over for the next four shows after making a guest appearance in the twelfth show. Harry Bartell was Archie for the remainder of the series. Nero Wolfe, also known as the galloping gourmet, was an armchair detective. He rarely left the house; instead his assistant, Archie Goodwin, would collect the facts and report back. Nero Wolfe would probably not have taken on many cases had he not needed the clientsâ money to pay for his two true passions: fine food and the collecting of orchids. Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's male secretary, prodded him into taking cases whenever the bank balance got a little low. Wolfe, as a character, is difficult to like. He's a self-assured type that does nothing unless he wants to, making his assistant, Archie Goodwin, deal with the outside world. <i>The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe</i> is based on a series of books begun in 1934 by Rex Stout. There were two previous incarnations of the radio series: <i>The Adventures of Nero Wolfe</i> which ran in 1943 and 1944 and <i>The New Adventures of (aka The Amazing) Nero Wolfe</i> which ran in 1945 to 1946. Very few episodes from these earlier series are in circulation today.

The Delmore Brothers, together with other brother duets such as the Louvin Brothers, the Blue Sky Boys, the Monroe Brothers (Birch, Charlie and Bill Monroe), the McGee Brothers, and The Stanley Brothers, had a profound impact on the history of country music and American popular music. The brothers were born into poverty in Elkmont, Alabama, as the sons of tenant farmers amid a rich tradition of gospel music and Appalachian folk. Their mother, Mollie Delmore, wrote and sang gospel songs for their church. The Delmores blended gospel-style harmonies with the quicker guitarwork of traditional folk music and the blues to help create the still-emerging genre of country. In addition to the regular six-string acoustic guitar, the duo was one of the few to use the rare tenor guitar, a four-string instrument that had primarily been used previously in vaudeville shows. In 1925 Alton wrote his first song \"Bound For the Shore\" at the age of 13, (co-written with his mother).It was published by Athens Music Co. The Brother's did their first recording session for Columbia in 1931, recording \"I've Got the Kansas City Blues\" and \"Alabama Lullaby\", which became their theme song. They signed a contract with Victor RecordÃ¢s budget label Bluebird in 1933 and became regulars on the Grand Ole Opry variety program Within three years, they had become the most popular act on the show. Disagreements with Opry management led to the brothers leaving the show in 1939. While they continued to play and record music throughout the 1940s, they never achieved the same level of success they had with the Grand Ole Opry. In 1941, their song \"When It's Time For The Whippoorwill To Sing\" made the Billboard \"Hillbilly\" top three. Their best-known song, \"Blues Stay Away From Me,\" is regarded by some as the first rock and roll record. It was covered by Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps, The Louvin Brothers and The Everly Brothers. Rabon died of lung cancer in 1952. Following Rabon's death, Alton suffered a heart attack, the loss of his father and his daughter Susan, all within a three-year period. He moved back in Huntsville, Alabama. He taught some guitar, did odd jobs, and devoted his creative energies to writing prose. He wrote a series of short stories and his autobiography, Truth is Stranger than Publicity, published posthumously in the 1970s. Over the course of their careers, the Delmores wrote more than one thousand songs. Some of the most popular were BrownÃ¢s Ferry Blues, Gonna Lay Down My Old Guitar and Fifteen Miles from Birmingham. We apologize for the poor sound quality of these recordings, but they are the best mp3s available. <font size=\"-2\">Information from Wikipedia</font> From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

Ironically, the episode was titled \"Devil Stone\" and was the last dramatic radio play from a series that had its roots in the golden age of radio. What began as a \"new series frankly dedicated to your horrification and entertainment\" took on a life of its own mostly due to the talents of some outstanding producers and adaptations and original stories from the cream of mystery writers of the time. The golden age of radio was truly the golden age of <i>SUSPENSE</i> as show after show broadcast outstanding plays which were \"calculated to intrigue...stir [the] nerves.\" It was the series' first producer, William Spier, who set the framework of rules that was to stay with the show for most of its run. Mr. Spier determined that the series should deal with life-and-death situations established near the beginning of each play and then through the use of Bernard Herrmann's musical coloring and the writer's characterizations slowly tighten the knot of <i>SUSPENSE</i>. Many of the early stories were written by the mystery writer, John Dickson Carr. Others were by such fine writers as Lucille Fletcher, whose <i>SUSPENSE</i> play, \"Sorry, Wrong Number\" was turned into a major motion picture; Robert Arthur, Robert L. Richards, Morton Fine and David Friedkin. The series also drew from the mystery writers of the day as well as the horror writers of literature; writers such as Edgar Allen Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, Cornell Woolrich, Dorthy L. Sayers and H.G. Wells. Many of the stories produced by Mr. Spier are now classics of the genre. Listen to the likes of \"The House in Cypress Canyon\" as a young couple encounters something in the closet of their new home, something horrible and dangerous; or \"The Hitchhiker\" in which a man driving cross-country seems to be haunted by an ominous figure, who keeps reappearing trying to get a ride. But what foreboding does the hitchhiker hold for the driver? Another rule William Spier established was to make the series a place to hear the talents of Hollywood's famous actors. There rarely was a famous actor who did not appear on the series at some time. Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, Lucille Ball, Olivia De Havilland and many others all made at least one appearance. The series had a generous budget from its network, CBS. In 1948 the series had become popular enough that it was decided to broadcast for a complete hour, instead of the former thirty minutes. The actor Robert Montgomery was brought in to introduce the plays, replacing the \"Man in Black\" character and occasionally star in them. This format lasted only six months most probably due to the realization that the show worked best within a thirty minute framework. It was at this time that William Spier left and over the years others came to produce the shows, each setting his own unique mark. Anton M. Leader, who came from producing another horror radio program, MURDER AT MIDNIGHT, added some lighter <i>SUSPENSE</i> stories which focused more on the central characters. Jimmy Stewart appeared in an excellent story about a paralysed war veteran who thinks he has found the man who imprisoned and tortured him. Fibber McGee & Molly appeared in a tale about a killer on the loose in \"Backseat Driver.\" Probably the biggest change in <i>SUSPENSE</i> came under the producing eye of Elliott Lewis. Lewis brought in comic actors to play serious roles. Actors such as Jack Benny, Red Skelton and Ozzie Nelson. He also was not afraid to experiment using the series slot for classic \"murder\" stories such as \"Othello.\" The series continued to produce high-quality drama, though there were many repeats as well as borrowing of scripts from other radio shows. While a number of film actors continued to star occasionally, many of the stars were from radio and television since radio as a dramatic art form was beginning to lose its popularity and budgets were tightened. The show was on the air for a little over twenty years beginning in January, 1942 and was rarely pre-empted. There were 947 performances. Nearly all (approximately 895) are available to collectors. When <i>SUSPENSE</i> left the air, radio was never to see the likes of such a series again. Now the great medium of radio where imagination can run free has been reduced to the occasional brilliant drama airing sporadically in some corner of the world. <i>SUSPENSE</i> was a golden moment in a golden age. A moment when the thrill of the nightime led the listener along the path of intrigue, horror and dangerous adventure. Permission for use granted by Jim Widner </blockquote>",

It was initially broadcast on radio from 1935 to 1953, and later on television from 1952 to 1957. Originally on CBS, then later changing to NBC, the series pioneered the use of anthology drama for company audio advertising. <i>The Cavalcade of America</i> documented historical events using stories of individual courage, initiative and achievement, often with feel-good dramatizations of the human spirit's triumph against all odds. This was consistent with Du Pont's overall conservative philosophy and legacy as an American company dating back to 1802. The company's motto, \"Maker of better things for better living through chemistry,\" was read at the beginning of each program, and the dramas emphasized humanitarian progress, particularly improvements in the lives of women, often through technological innovation. Martin Grams, Jr. is the author of the highly-acclaimed publication, \"The History of the Cavalcade of America\", the authorized guide to the history of the popular radio/television series. The 500 page book is available from all major bookstores, including Amazon.com and Borders.com. This book comes highly recommended. It served as an invaluable resource with determining correct titles of episodes. It features an extensive episode guide. Each episode has the names of the radio actors, which allowed, in the case of repeated shows, one production to be distinguished from another.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">THEATRE ROYAL</font></b></u></i></p> This fine British anthology series, features plays based on the best of literature, films and English theater. Produced in two series, Sir Lawrence Olivier and Sir Ralph Richardson serve as hosts, narrators and many times portray the leading roles. The program apparently was developed as a vehicle to capitalize on Olivier’s name and talent. His career spanned over 50 years and continues into the 21st century, as in 2004, 15 years after his death, he was starring as Dr. Totenkopf in a Hollywood fantasy film titled, <i>Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow</i>. This was accomplished by the producers who selected footage of Lord Olivier from various films and used to create a villainous leader of killer robots in the film. Jude Law, who stars in the film, said film-makers used Olivier because few other actors possessed his authority. Sir Ralph Richardson from 1954 – 1955 played the character of Dr. John Watson in another Harry Alan Towers radio series of Sherlock Holmes stories, which starred Sir John Gielgud as the famous consulting detective. Many fine actors of the British stage and screen were involved in individual episodes of the <i>Theatre Royal</i> series, such as Sir John Gielgud, Robert Morley, Harry Andrews, Muriel Forbes, Robert Donat, and Daphne Maddox. The music was credited to the renown British organist and arranger, Sidney Torch. However much of the same music was also used in other Harry Alan Towers productions on which Torch also worked, such as <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Secrets_Of_Scotland_Yard\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Secrets of Scotland Yard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Black_Museum\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Black Museum</a>, and <i>The Many Lives of Harry Lime</i>. So how much of it was actually written for this series will probably never be known. Harry Alan Towers produced and directed the show for his Towers of London company for international syndication, at the time in Europe, South Africa and Australia. The episodes included in this distribution are from the initial US run on NBC. However selected episodes were repeated, with a different series opening and close on the ABC Mystery Time series during the late 1950s. The show <i>Theatre Royal</i> remained in active syndication in the United States well up into the 1970s. Many of the copies in circulation today, come from those 1970s repeats where the individual episodes were cut to about 20 minutes. Luckily these cuts were made by the production company and generally do not take away from the actual program enjoyment. This reduced length comes from a combination for factors including removing dated introductory material from the beginning of the early episodes, making time for local stations to include hourly 5 minute newscasts and to insert commercials locally. In conclusion, this series consisted of new radio adaptations of famous, and not so famous stories by some of the best authors in the United States and England. It is the inclusion of some of those little known masterpieces by many familiar authors that gives the series a variety element usually missing in this type of anthology series. Its long syndication run, well into the 70s, proves once again classic stories presented by talented actors never really goes out of style. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">FORT LARAMIE</font></b></u></i></p> <i>Fort Laramie</i> opened with \"Specially transcribed tales of the dark and tragic ground of the wild frontier. The saga of fighting men who rode the rim of empire and the dramatic story of Lee Quince, Captain of Cavalry\". When Norman Macdonnell created <i>Fort Laramie</i> in late 1955, he made it clear to his writers that historical accuracy was essential to the integrity of the series. Correct geographic names, authentic Indian practices, military terminology, and utilizing actual names of the original buildings of the real fort, was insisted upon. So when the radio characters referred to the sutler's store (which is what the trading post was called prior to 1870), the surgeon's quarters, Old Bedlam (the officers' quarters) or the old bakery, they were naming actual structures in the original fort. While Macdonnell planned to use the same writers, soundmen, and supporting actors in <i>Fort Laramie</i> that he relied upon in <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Gunsmoke\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gunsmoke</a>, he naturally picked different leads. Heading up the cast was a 39 year old, Canadian-born actor with a long history in broadcasting and the movies, Raymond Burr. He had begun his career in 1939, alternating between the stage and radio. He turned to Hollywood, and from 1946 until he got the part of Captain Lee Quince in <i>Fort Laramie</i> in 1956, he had appeared in thirty-seven films. A few were excellent (<i>Rear Window</i>, <i>The Blue Gardenia</i>) some were average (<i>Walk a Crooked Mile</i>, <i>A Place in the Sun</i>) but many were plain awful (<i>Bride of Vengeance</i>, <i>Red Light</i>, and <i>Abandoned</i>). With Burr in the lead, Macdonnell selected two supporting players: Vic Perrin as \"Sgt. Goerss\" and Jack Moyles as \"Major Daggett\", the commanding officer of the post. (The original Fort Laramie usually had a Lieutenant Colonel as the C.O. but Macdonnell probably preferred a shorter military title.) Perrin, a 40 year old veteran radio actor had been in countless productions, but had achieved name recognition only on <i>The Zane Grey Show</i> where he played the lead, \"Tex Thorne.\" Jack Moyles was also a busy radio actor, having started in 1935 in <i>Hawthorne House</i>, with later major roles in <i>Romance</i>, <i>Twelve Players</i>, <i>Night Editor</i> as well as the lead in <i>A Man Called Jordan</i>. From 1947 to 1948 he was a regular in <i>The Adventures of Philip Marlowe</i>, which Norman Macdonnell directed, although this may not have been their first association. By the mid-1950s when <i>Fort Laramie</i> began, most of the actors on the west coast were doing some television and movie work so the program was rehearsed and taped for transcription during the evening. Once a week the cast and crew gathered at CBS Studio One in Hollywood to tape the show. In 1956 this was the last radio production studio in use in California. The series debuted on January 22, 1956 with an episode entitled \"Playing Indian.\" <i>Fort Laramie</i> aired forty one episodes from January 22, 1956 to October 28, 1956. An audition episode was recorded on July 25, 1955. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">SINGLES AND DOUBLES COLLECTION: H - K</font></b></u></i></p> This is a work in progress. This OTRR Collection is a Non-Certified one, containing series in which currently only one or two episodes are known to exist -- hence the name: \"Singles and Doubles Collection\". Almost every type genre is included. Radio -- called by some <i>The Theater of the Mind</i> -- has been with us since 1920 when stations WWJ of Detroit and KDKA of Pittsburg made the first regular commercial broadcasts. The first program aimed at entertaining the unseen audience followed close behind. Over the years since then, literally thousands of series have been broadcast nationally and thousands more in regional or local markets. Some endured for a few years, others for 20 or 30, and some unfortunately only had one episode broadcast. Of those thousands, some series saw some of their episodes saved for the future, some saw nearly all and others only one or two episodes. While the goal of the Old Time Radio Researchers Group is to preserve radios past by collecting, and archiving as many different series as possible and making them available to the community, we do not want to let the series that only had a minimum number of episodes to survive go unpreserved for future generations. To that end we have put together this unique collection of series. Most of the programs you will find here will be totally unfamilar to you, but they are informative and entertaining none the less. This is the second version of this collection that we have released. Since the first collection new broadcasts have surfaced, and others will undoubtely be found in the future. When and if that occurs, we will release a version three. From comedy to drama to cooking shows to music, you'll hear it all here, and every episode will be unique and different. They run the gamut, from the middle 20s to the early 70s, all showing us a glimpse of the past, when things were slower and families gathered round the radio each evening. Times when each person was hearing the same thing, but created a different picture in their minds of what the characters looked like, the scenery, location, and most important the sounds. Sounds that each found a different meaning in, but one that entertained, educated, and made the world a smaller place, where you could hear those stories that in the past were told to just a few, gathered round the dinner table, at a campfire, or in small audiences, but now the whole world could hear and enjoy. Some of these episodes may be misnamed or misdated. If you find such, please let us know. Additionally there may be some dead air space at the beginning or ending of some episodes. This is not one of our certified sets, it is being provided as a way to obtain those series in which only one or two shows have survived. This page contains Series beginning with the letters H through K. A text file containing a list of the MP3 files found on this page appears near the bottom of the page.

Initially written by Leonard Lewis Levinson, it was one of broadcast history's earliest spin-off programs. The series was built around the character Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve, a regular element of the radio situation comedy <i> Fibber McGee and Molly</i>. The character was introduced in the October 3, 1939 episode (number 216) of that series. <i> The Great Gildersleeve</i> enjoyed its greatest popularity in the 1940s. Actor Harold Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spinoff and later in four feature films released at the height of the show's popularity. In <i> Fibber McGee and Molly</i>, Peary's Gildersleeve had been a pompous windbag and nemesis of Fibber McGee. \"You're a haa-aa-aa-aard man, McGee!\" became a Gildersleeve catchphrase. The character went by several aliases on Fibber McGee and Molly; his middle name was revealed to be \"Philharmonic\" in \"Gildersleeve's Diary\" episode on October 22, 1940. \"Gildy\" grew so popular that Kraft Foodsâpromoting its Parkay margarineâsponsored a new series featuring Peary's somewhat mellowed and always befuddled Gildersleeve as the head of his own family. Premiere <i> The Great Gildersleeve</i> premiered on NBC on August 31, 1941. It moves the title character from the McGees' Wistful Vista to Summerfield, where Gildersleeve oversees his late brother-in-law's estate and rears his orphaned niece and nephew, Marjorie and Leroy Forrester. The household also includes a cook named Birdie. While Gildersleeve had occasionally mentioned his (unseen) wife in some Fibber episodes, in his own series he is a confirmed bachelor. At the outset of the series, Gildersleeve administers a girdle manufacturing company (\"If you want a better corset, of course, it's a Gildersleeve\"); later and during the remainder of the show he serves as Summerfield's water commissioner. Family A key figure in the Gildersleeve home was (black) cook and housekeeper Birdie Lee Coggins (Lillian Randolph). In the first season, under writer Levinson, Birdie was often portrayed as less than intelligent, but she slowly developed as the real brains and caretaker of the household under Whedon and other writers. Marjorie (originally played by Lurene Tuttle, later by Louise Erickson and Mary Lee Robb) matured to a young woman through the 1940s. During the ninth season (September 1949-June 1950) she met and married Walter \"Bronco\" Thompson (Richard Crenna), star football player at the local college. Look devoted five pages in its May 23, 1950, issue to the wedding. After living in the same household for a few years, the newlyweds moved next door. Leroy (Walter Tetley), who remained age 10â11 during most of the 1940s, began to grow up in the spring of 1949, establishing relationships with the girls in the Bullard home across the street. He developed interests in driving, playing the drums and dreaming of a musical career. Neighbors and friends Outside the home, Gildersleeve's closest association was with the executor of his brother-in-law's estate, Judge Horace Hooker (Earle Ross), with whom he had many battles during the first few broadcast seasons. After a change in scriptwriters in January 1943, the confrontations slowly subsided and the two men became friends. During the second season, pharmacist Richard Q. Peavey (Richard LeGrand) and barber Floyd Munson (Mel Blanc for the first year, Arthur Q. Bryan from December 1942 onward) joined Gildersleeve's circle of acquaintances. In the fourth season, these three friends, along with Police Chief Donald Gates (Ken Christy), formed the nucleus of the Jolly Boys Club, whose activities revolve around practicing barbershop quartet songs between sips of Coca-Cola. Several women passed through Gildersleeve's life during the series, including three he almost married before settling into a pattern of casual dating. Decline and fall In 1950, Harold Peary was convinced to move <i> The Great Gildersleeve</i> to CBS, but sponsor Kraft refused to sanction the move. Peary, now contracted to CBS, was legally unable to appear on NBC as a star performer, but <i> Gildersleeve</i> was still an NBC series. This prompted the hiring of Willard Waterman as Peary's replacement. Peary, meanwhile, began a new series on CBS which attempted to reproduce the Gildersleeve show with the names changed. The Harold Peary Show, lasting one season, included a fictitious radio show within the show. This was Honest Harold, hosted by Peary's new character. Starting in mid-1952, some of the program's long-time characters (Judge Hooker, Floyd Munson, Marjorie and her husband, Bronco) were missing for months at a time. In their place were a few new ones (Mr. Cooley the Egg Man, and Mrs. Potter the hypochondriac) who would last only a month or so. By 1953, Gildersleeve's love life took center stage over his family and friends. His many love interests were constantly shifting, and women came and went with great frequency. In 1954 the show's format changed drastically. After missing the fall schedule, it finally appeared in November as 15-minute episodes that aired five times a week. Only Gildersleeve, Leroy and Birdie remained on a continuing basis. All other characters were seldom heard, and gone were Marjorie and her family as well as the studio audience, live orchestra and original scripts The material for this series synopsis was originally published at www.wikipedia.com <font size=\"-2\"></font> <b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>The Great Gildersleeve <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>May 11, 2015 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of DVDs/CDs: </b>2/9 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

On July 29, 1935, the show moved to Monday night at 9:00 PM on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Radio\" rel=\"nofollow\">CBS</a>, where it would stay until June 29, 1954. The show moved to Hollywood on May 25, 1936 with the production of <i>The Legionnaire and the Lady</i>, based on the film <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco_%28film%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morocco</a></i>, starring <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlene_Dietrich\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marlene Dietrich</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clark Gable</a>. The audience for this production was estimated as high as 40 million. The show featured many of the most important films of the period, adapted to fit the 60 minute time slot.

For its last season, (1954-1955), the show moved to Tuesday nights at 9 on NBC.<br /><br /><i>Lux Radio Theatre</i> was always broadcast live, with a studio audience and a full orchestra accompanying the performance and providing musical transitions between scenes. As many film actors were used to numerous takes and not live performance, they sometimes suffered acute stage fright before the show. However, since most received $5,000 for their performance â in addition to free publicity for upcoming pictures â actors appeared in their original screen roles if they were available. Indeed, production would halt if necessary on a film if performers were called to appear on Lux. When the actors were not available, others stepped in. The plays were assembled and rehearsed for a week, in sharp contrast to many other shows, which required a minimal of an actorâs time. Regular players for the series included Jim and Marian Jordan, otherwise known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fibber McGee and Molly</a>.

You will find the series has a medical thread running through it and is in fact a highly compelling and sympathetic series of well-produced, medical-themed dramas. Within the stories, you get a great deal of medical history into the bargain. While the theme ties them all together, you will find these 13 productions stand on their own as good drama. They recall a period of amazing advances in common medical science, as well as recalling Medical Profession was a true vocation and the majority of its practitioners practiced their Hippocratic oath with integrity. Based on true stories and sponsored by Schenley Labs, Inc, who skimped on nothing with this brief series. The principal actors represent some of the finest talent of Stage and Screen, and the supporting Radio voice talent represent the era's finest radio actors. Leith Stevens provided a wonderful musical backdrop and William Lawrence's direction remains well-paced and timed. These charming dramas were based on medical research or the personal stories of medical workers. This series is one of the Golden Age of Radio's true, overlooked gems, both collectable and relevant to this day -- perhaps even moreso, given the current state of Health Care in the United States.

This was a radical departure in character for Mr. Powell from a Hollywood song and dance man to a hard-boiled detective. On June 11,1945, the <i>Lux Radio Theater</i> brought \"Murder My Sweet\" to radio, again with Dick Powell in the lead. These two performances prompted his selection for the part of Richard Rogue, in <i>Rogue’s Gallery</i> after his role for <i>Lux Radio Theater</i> and Richard Diamond came four years later. <i>Richard Diamond, Private Detective</i> came to NBC in 1949. Diamond was a slick, sophisticated detective, with a sharp tongue for folks who needed it. Diamond enjoyed the detective life, but not as much as entertaining his girl, Helen Asher. After each show, he would croon a number to his Park Avenue sweetheart. Mr. Powell, a former song and dance man, was perfect for the role. He added an extra dimension to the 40's hokey private eye drama. Diamond was a rough gumshoe that would often get knocked on the head with a revolver butt or other items. His counterpart on the police force was Lt. Levinson who often accepted Diamond's help reluctantly. Levinson would claim to get stomach trouble whenever Diamond would call him and would take bicarbonate to settle his aching stomach. Although they always seem at odds with each other, Diamond and Levinson were best friends. The plot theme remained fairly constant throughout the entire run of the show, Diamond getting beat up and solving a tough murder case with the support of the police department. Remarkably, for all the gun fights, Diamond never got shot. And for all his bravado, he had a serious case of vertigo. Helen Asher was portrayed by Virginia Gregg, who also played the part of Brooksie on <i>Let George Do It</i> and Betty Lewis on <i>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar</i>. Blake Edwards wrote the early shows and also directed a few. Music was composed by David Baskerville and later by Frank Wirth. In January of 1951, the series moved to ABC under the full sponsorship of Camel cigarettes. Then in May of 1953, the series moved to CBS but all shows were repeats from the 1950-51 Rexall sponsored season on NBC. Richard Diamond was one of the radio shows which successfully moved to television with David Janssen, later of <i>The Fugitive</i> fame, in the title role of Richard Diamond. The opening scene of the television show often featured the long lovely legs of Mary Tyler Moore, who went on to fame in <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show</i> and <i>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</i>. Mary was replaced on the <i>Richard Diamond</i> show when it became known that she owned the mystery legs. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Richard Diamond, Private Detective <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>May 26, 2007 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 2b(July 22, 2008) <b>Number of CDs: </b>5 <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!</font></b></i></p> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

This OTRR Collection is a Non-Certified one, containing series in which currently only one or two episodes are known to exist -- hence the name: \"Singles and Doubles Collection\". Almost every type genre is included. Radio -- called by some <i>The Theater of the Mind</i> -- has been with us since 1920 when stations WWJ of Detroit and KDKA of Pittsburg made the first regular commercial broadcasts. The first program aimed at entertaining the unseen audience followed close behind. Over the years since then, literally thousands of series have been broadcast nationally and thousands more in regional or local markets. Some endured for a few years, others for 20 or 30, and some unfortunately only had one episode broadcast. Of those thousands, some series saw some of their episodes saved for the future, some saw nearly all and others only one or two episodes. While the goal of the Old Time Radio Researchers Group is to preserve radios past by collecting, and archiving as many different series as possible and making them available to the community, we do not want to let the series that only had a minimum number of episodes to survive go unpreserved for future generations. To that end we have put together this unique collection of series. Most of the programs you will find here will be totally unfamilar to you, but they are informative and entertaining none the less. This is the second version of this collection that we have released. Since the first collection new broadcasts have surfaced, and others will undoubtely be found in the future. When and if that occurs, we will release a version three. From comedy to drama to cooking shows to music, you'll hear it all here, and every episode will be unique and different. They run the gamut, from the middle 20s to the early 70s, all showing us a glimpse of the past, when things were slower and families gathered round the radio each evening. Times when each person was hearing the same thing, but created a different picture in their minds of what the characters looked like, the scenery, location, and most important the sounds. Sounds that each found a different meaning in, but one that entertained, educated, and made the world a smaller place, where you could hear those stories that in the past were told to just a few, gathered round the dinner table, at a campfire, or in small audiences, but now the whole world could hear and enjoy. Some of these episodes may be misnamed or misdated. If you find such, please let us know. Additionally there may be some dead air space at the beginning or ending of some episodes. This is not one of our certified sets, it is being provided as a way to obtain those series in which only one or two shows have survived. This page contains Series beginning with the letters D through G. A text file containing a list of the MP3 files found on this page appears near the end of the file section.

The program was a soap opera centered on newlyweds David and Claudia Naughton. It followed the problems and the successes, big and small, of an average newly-married couple, including the need for thrift, having an overhanded mother-in-law, and all those charming little moments of life. The program began as a skit on <i>The Kate Smith Hour</i> in 1941, and was expanded into a full summer series a month later. In those original shows, Claudia was played by Patricia Ryan and David by Richard Kollmar. Franken and Meloneyâs stories were collected into books that were adapted into a pair of RKO films, <i>Claudia</i> in 1943 and <i>Claudia and David</i> in 1946. Both films starred Robert Young and Dorothy McGuire. The success of the films prompted Coca-Cola to sponsor a 15-minute syndicated weekday radio program in the 1947-1948 season, starring Kathryn Bard and Paul Crabtree. The Claudia and David stories also spawned two TV movies in the late fifties, as well as British and German television adaptations. <font size=\"-2\"></font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Claudia <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>October 1, 2012 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>4 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

It starred Bob Bailey as detective-for-hire George Valentine (with Olan Soule stepping into the role in 1954). Clients came to Valentine's office after reading a newspaper carrying his classified ad: <blockquote><i>Personal notice: Danger's my stock in trade. If the job's too tough for you to handle, you've got a job for me. George Valentine.</i></blockquote> The few earliest episodes were more sitcom than private eye shows, with a studio audience providing scattered laughter at the not-so-funny scripts. Soon the audience was banished, and George went from stumbling comedic hero to tough guy private eye and the music from wah-wah-wah to suspenseful. Valentine's secretary was Claire Brooks, aka Brooksie (Frances Robinson, Virginia Gregg, Lillian Buyeff). As Valentine made his rounds in search of the bad guys, he usually encountered Brooksie's kid brother, Sonny (Eddie Firestone), Lieutenant Riley (Wally Maher) and elevator man Caleb (Joseph Kearns). For the first few shows, Sonny was George's assistant, but he was soon relegated to an occasional character. Sponsored by Standard Oil, the program was broadcast on the West Cast Mutual Broadcasting System from October 18, 1946 to September 27, 1954, first on Friday evenings and then on Mondays. In its last season, transcriptions were aired in New York, Wednesdays at 9:30pm, from January 20, 1954 to January 12, 1955. John Hiestand was the program's announcer. Don Clark directed the scripts by David Victor and Jackson Gillis. The background music was supplied by Eddie Dunstedter, initially with a full orchestra. When television supplanted radio as the country's primary home entertainment, radio budgets got skimpier and skimpier and Dunstedter's orchestra was replaced by an organ. <font size=\"2\">Information from WikiPedia</font> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

It was broadcast over the Columbia â Don Lee Coast radio network. The schedule was 3 nights a week, Sunday, Wednesday and Friday at 7:45 PM (6:45 during summer daylight savings time). The sponsor was Ex-Lax. In late September 1935 the show changed to two shows per week, dropping the Sunday show. In late September 1936 the schedule changed again to Tuesday and Friday nights. A 1936 booklet of the <i>Strange As It Seems</i> stories was sponsored by Ex-Lax and given away as a free promotion of the radio program by writing to the station. The show was hosted by Gayne Whitman, produced and directed by Cyril Armbrister and the music was composed and directed by Felix Mills. Whitman had been the announcer on the <i>Strange As It Seems</i> movie shorts from 1930 - 1934. The programs included 2 or 3 segments of dramatized events in mini plays with dramatic, fanfare music interspersed in the show between segments. After the opening line, an Ex-Lax commercial would follow. Then 2 or 3 strange stories would be presented. The show would conclude with a preview of the next show's stories, an Ex-Lax commercial, a strange fact of trivia, such as \"Butterflies smell with their feet\" and finally a short musical ending. There were occasionally live interviews with unusual personalities, such as the World's Fastest Talker. Many of the programs were distributed on 16\" 33 RPM records with one 15 minute show on each side. Many sources list at least 39 of these records with a total of 78 programs recorded. This run of the shows concluded at the end of January 1937, after over 210 shows. The show began again in January 1938 as a 15 minute once a week program, airing on Sunday afternoons at 3:00 (2:00 during daylight savings time). The show ended at the end of December 1938, with 53 shows in this run. The <i>Strange As It Seems</i> radio program was picked up as a 30 minute network program on the CBS network from August 17, 1939 to Dec. 26, 1940 on Thursdays at 8:30 P.M. (7:30 P.M. during the summer daylight savings time). There were 72 broadcasts of these half hour broadcasts. The sponsor was Palmolive Shave Cream and the host was Alois Havrilla. Havrilla was the announcer on the <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i> movie shorts beginning in 1934 and continuing in that role until the shorts were ended in 1942. <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i> was the successor to the <i>Strange As It Seems</i> movie shorts that ran from 1930 until 1934. The program had one final run in its original 15 minute format from Nov. 10, 1946 to April 13, 1947, airing at 7:30 PM on Sunday nights. There were 22 episodes aired in this run. In the newspaper story about the death of John Hix on June 6, 1944, Ernest Hix stated there were over 600 radio programs produced, indicating there were other shows than those so far identified. <font size=\"-2\"></font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Strange As It Seems <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Accurate <b>Certification Date: </b>September 3, 2012 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 1 <b>Number of CDs: </b>2 From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

Fritz Lang used an similar premise in his 1930s German movie with Peter Lorre playing <i>M</i>, a psychopathic murderer of children. But the American radio series was even creepier. The unseen Whistler didn't kill anyone (that we know of), but he certainly loved watching murders take place, narrating them for us, and chuckling at the suffering of others instead of doing anything to stop it. Unlike <i>M</i>, he was never caught. He kept walking the streets every week for thirteen long years, whistling his ominous thirteen notes and telling us another tale of bizarre fate. Perhaps Fate is who the Whistler really was? He never provided any sir name, and the killer was usually punished by some twist of fate that only The Whistler seemed to expect. It is very likely <i>The Whistler</i> was inspired by <i>The Shadow</i>, which began nearly a decade earlier. Like the Shadow, the Whistler seemed to enter and exit the criminal underworld without ever being seen. He would watch the evil doers carry out their schemes, yet they never saw him, even though he would tell us what they were thinking in their presence. His voice sounded equally sinister to The Shadow, too. It was was a slithering tenor, hissing the \"s's\" and often laughing \"heh-heh-heh-hehheh!\" at the foolishness of the guilty. Both series had similar opening lines: <i>The Shadow</i> \"knew what evil lurked in the hearts of men\", whereas <i>The Whistler</i> \"knows many strange tales hidden in the hearts of men and women who have stepped into the shadows.\" When Bill Forman served 1/2 year in the military, Marvin Miller substituted as <i>The Whistler</i>. Also like <i>The Shadow</i>, several different actors played the title role over the course of <i>The Whistler</i> series. Bill Forman played it the most, but his announcer (Marvin Miller) substituted for him during the six months of his army duty (Buxton, 256). Gale Gordon and Joseph Kearns voiced the Whistler in earlier days, while Everett Clarke played the character in 1947 and Bill Johnstone did in 1948 (Dunning, 719). The last similarity was the saddest one. Both series ended about the time frame (in the mid 1950s). Crime increased in the following decades, maybe because the guilty felt they were no longer being watched and could get away with murder. Or could it be that the Whistler is saving up some more great stories to tell us about in the future? <font size=\"-2\">This Article courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.radiohorrorhosts.com/whistler.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.radiohorrorhosts.com/whistler.html</a>.</font> </blockquote>",

That series lasted 41 broadcasts. Near the end of the year, the network launched <i>Have Gun, Will Travel</i> on November 11, 1958, which continued for 106 programs. In between, a very short series was offered and discontinued after only 16 broadcasts, <i>Luke Slaughter Of Tombstone</i>. Sam Buffington starred as Luke Slaughter, a Civil War cavalryman who turned to cattle ranching in post war Arizona territory near Fort Huachuca. William N. Robson, known from his work with such series as <i>Escape</i>, <i>Suspense</i> and <i>The CBS Radio Workshop</i>, directed. Sam Buffington enacted the title role on <i>Luke Slaughter of Tombstone</i>, another of CBS's prestigious adult Westerns. The series was produced and directed by William N.

The stories Chet relates to us are all quite fanciful. They deal with topics that would be classified supernatural and science fiction. They border on outrageous but that is how they are meant to be. Roughly half of the shows feature a nice, likeable, rural southern manure hauler by the name of Elmer Korn who always finds himself involved in some inane predicament. The creators of the series themselves admit the show is rather off-beat but, you will find, not without it’s own charm which lies within the humorous writing and the recurring characters. This series was created and produced by M&J Audio Theater. The M stands for Mark Sawyer and the J is for Jay Reel. Two childhood friends who met in the 6th grade in 1977 with a tape recorder that had a mutual interest in radio drama as influenced by old time radio shows such as <i>X Minus One</i>, <i>Lum and Abner</i>, and <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Gunsmoke\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gunsmoke</a>. One can hear these influences in every story from the subject matter and the character voices, to the plots. The creaking door opening, the host’s oddly humorous manner and the “pleasant dreams” ending are an undeniable salute to <i>The Inner Sanctum</i> and Himan Brown. Between the two of them, Mark and Jay collaborate to do over 20 characters in these stories. Jay is the voice of Chet Chetter, Elmer Corn, the Sherrif, Roland, and Gale Headrush Taylor. Mark only admits to being the voice of Cecil Farris and incidental characters. Mark and Jay produced the first Chet Chetter story, \"The Highway of Death\" in 1989. It was born from a series of 95 episodes which they did over a period of years from 1980 to 1995. They call it \"The Conofrof Saga\". They submitted \"The Highway of Death\" to National Public Radio and were amazed when NPR responded with an order for 3 more stories. The 4 episodes were accepted and broadcast on NPR Playhouse in 1990. The following year NPR ordered 9 more installments of <i>Tales From the Morgue</i> to be broadcast as a complete 13 show series in 1992. There were a total of 19 shows produced but 6 were rejected by NPR. M and J are quick to point out that rejection by NPR has no bearing on the quality of the show. The rejections merely reflect the stringent guidelines NPR had for broadcast content at the time. During the 90’s <i>Tales From the Morgue</i> proved so popular that it aired internationally in Australia and England. Some episodes were featured three times on Sue Zizza’s Radio Works including one non-morgue show The Spirit of 76 Marina Hootin’ Nanny. Mark and Jay developed a new series called M&J Presents due largely to feeling creatively stifled by NPR’s rigid standards. With their new series there were no rules, no restrictions. Anything could be done and was. The shows varied in content and story lines. For them it was more like a miscellaneous collection from the M&J archives. Unfortunately M&J Audio Theater has not produced any new material in over 10 years at the time of this writing but don’t count them out. They have the same love for theater of the mind as we do and both Mark and Jay would fervently like to return to it at some point. At present Mark and Jay are co-directing, producing, writing and editing a movie based on the first episode of Chet Chetter, \"The Highway of Death\". <font size=\"1\">Information was supplied by Mark Sawyer, co creator of <i>Chet Chetter's Tales From the Morgue</i>.</font> <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Chet Chetter's Tales from the Morgue <b>Certification Status: </b>OTRR Certified Complete <b>Certification Date: </b>October 20, 2005 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 2 <b>Number of CDs: </b>1 From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

Strange that so little good science fiction came out of radio; they seem ideally compatible, both relying heavily on imagination. Some fine isolated science fiction stories were developed on the great anthology shows, <i>Suspense</i> and <i>Escape</i>. But until the premiere of <i>Dimension X</i> -- a full two decades after network radio was established -- there were no major science fiction series of broad appeal to adults. This show dramatized the work of such young writers as Ray Bradbury, Robert (Psycho) Bloch, Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and Kurt Vonnegut. In-house script writer was Ernest Kinoy, who adapted the master works and contributed occasional storied of his own. <i>Dimension X</i> was a very effective demonstration of what could be done with science fiction on the air. It came so late that nobody cared, but some of the stories stand as classics of the medium. Bradbury's \"Mars Is Heaven\" is as gripping today as when first heard. His \"Martian Chronicles\" was one of the series' most impressive offerings. <i>Dimension X</i> played heavily on an \"adventures in time and space, told in future tense\" theme.

Keen (he never had a first name, unless it was “Peachy”) was assisted in these duties by an Irishman named Mike Clancy. Mike wasn’t much of a brainiac (the quote that comprises the title of this post was a semi-catchphrase that he seemed to use on the show every week) but he could use the necessary brawn when the situation called for it. <a href=\"http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?ID=48062\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bennett Kilpack</a> played kindly ol' Keen throughout most of the program’s run, as well as Philip Clarke and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Hughes_%28actor%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arthur Hughes, </a>while Jim Kelly took the role of Clancy. The series originally aired as a thrice-weekly fifteen-minute serial from 1937-43 (the show moved to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS\" rel=\"nofollow\">CBS</a> in 1942), providing more than ample time for Keen to solve even the most baffling of disappearances. Beginning November 11, 1943, the program changed its format to that of a half-hour weekly offering—and though the title and theme song remained, Keen branched out into investigating murders. If <i>Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons</i> sounds a little soap opera-ish, it’s because it originated from the “radio fiction factory” of Frank and Anne Hummert. (Frank received on-air credit for the writing, but the scripts were actually churned out by scribes like Lawrence Klee, Bob Shaw, Barbara Bates and Stedman Coles.) Mr. Keen“ employed all the stereotypes, heavy dialogue, and trite plotting of its daytime cousins” and “it appealed to a lowest common denominator.” So why is the show so popular with old-time radio fans today? Simple…it’s pretty doggone funny, in an unintentional sort of way. <i>Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons</i> enjoyed a healthy eighteen-year stint over radio, ending its run not—as previously reported on this blog—on April 19, 1955 but on September 26 of that same year. Over the years, the series had a variety of sponsors: Bisodol, Kolynos toothpaste, Chesterfield cigarettes, American Chicle, etc., and there are nearly sixty broadcasts extant today for modern-day listeners to revel in. It’s ample evidence that not every show during the Golden Age of Radio was “golden”—but I gotta admit, it sure is fun. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated from Version 4.1 MP3s (25-Feb-2011). </font></b></i></p> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

It was based on the popular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_film_series\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Dr. Kildare</i> movies</a> of the late 1930's and early 1940's, and brought to the microphone the stars of that series, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lew_Ayres\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lew Ayres</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Barrymore\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lionel Barrymore</a>. Ayres played the young, idealistic Dr. James Kildare; Barrymore, ever in character, was the crusty, loveable diagnostician, Dr. Leonard Gillespie. The men worked at Blair General Hospital, \"one of the great citadels of American medicine -- a clump of gray-white buildings planted deep in the heart of New York -- where life begins, where life ends, where life goes on.\" Kildare really believed that oath, and that's what this series was all about. His battle with hospital administration, stupid patients, and stupid parents made this the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Welby\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Marcus Welby</i></a> of the 1940's. The chief problem, both for Kildare and the listener, was that Blair Hospital was peopled by too many eccentrics. Gillespie, played to the limit by Barrymore, was enough for any show. But Dr. Carew, head of hospital administration, was a nut of the first order. Nurse Parker was a totally unbelievable old maid. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Osborne\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ted Osborne</a> did what he could with Carew, and Virginia Gragg's fine talent was hopelessly lost in the chattering role of Parker.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">INNER SANCTUM MYSTERIES</font></b></u></i></p> The anthology series featured stories of mystery, terror and suspense, and its tongue-in-cheek introductions were in sharp contrast to shows like <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Suspense\" rel=\"nofollow\">Suspense</a> and <i>The Whistler</i>. The early 1940s programs opened with Raymond Edward Johnson introducing himself as, \"Your host, Raymond,\" in a mocking sardonic voice. A spooky melodramatic organ score (played by Lew White) punctuated Raymond's many morbid jokes and playful puns. Raymond's closing was an elongated \"Pleasant dreeeeaams, hmmmmm?\" His tongue-in-cheek style and ghoulish relish of his own tales became the standard for many such horror narrators to follow, from fellow radio hosts like Ernest Chappell (on Wyllis Cooper's later series, <i>Quiet, Please</i>) and Maurice Tarplin (on <i>The Mysterious Traveler</i>). When Johnson left the series in May 1945 to serve in the Army, he was replaced by Paul McGrath, who did not keep the \"Raymond\" name and was known only as \"Your Host\" or \"Mr. Host\" (Berry Kroeger had substituted earlier for a total of four episodes). McGrath was a Broadway actor who turned to radio for a regular income. Beginning in 1945, Lipton Tea sponsored the series, pairing first Raymond and then McGrath with cheery commercial spokeswoman Mary Bennett (aka the \"Tea Lady\"), whose blithesome pitches for Lipton Tea contrasted sharply with the macabre themes of the stories. She primly chided the host for his trademark dark humor and creepy manner. The Creaking Door: The program's familiar and famed audio trademark was the eerie creaking door which opened and closed the broadcasts. Himan Brown got the idea from a door in the basement that \"squeaked like Hell.\" The door sound was actually made by a rusty desk chair. The program did originally intend to use a door, but on its first use, the door did not creak. Undaunted, Brown grabbed a nearby chair, sat in it and turned, causing a hair-raising squeak. The chair was used from then on as the sound prop. On at least one memorable occasion, a staffer innocently repaired and oiled the chair, thus forcing the sound man to mimic the squeak orally. Guest Stars: Its campy comedy notwithstanding, the stories were usually effective little chillers, mixing horror and humor in equal doses. Memorable episodes included \"Terror by Night\" (September 18, 1945) and an adaptation of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" (August 3, 1941). The latter starred Boris Karloff, who was heard regularly in the first season, starring in more than 15 episodes and returning sporadically thereafter. Other established stars in the early years included Mary Astor, Helen Hayes, Peter Lorre, Paul Lukas, Claude Rains, Frank Sinatra, and Orson Welles. Most of the lead and supporting players were stalwarts of New York radio. These included Santos Ortega, Mercedes McCambridge, Berry Kroeger, Lawson Zerbe, Arnold Moss, Leon Janney, and Mason Adams. Players like Richard Widmark, Everett Sloane, Burgess Meredith, Agnes Moorehead, Ken Lynch, and Anne Seymour, also found fame via the <i>Inner Sanctum Mysteries</i>. Out of more than 500 programs broadcast, only about 200 remain in circulation, sometimes minus dates or titles. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release! Version 2: Corrected mislabeled shows.

    "description": "<blockquote><br /><p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">MR AND MRS NORTH</font></b></u></i></p><br /><br />Mr. and Mrs. North are fictional American amateur detectives. Created by Frances and Richard Lockridge, the couple were featured in a series of 26 Mr. and Mrs. North novels, a Broadway play, a motion picture and several radio and television series.<br /><br />Mr. and Mrs. North was a radio mystery series that aired on CBS from 1942 to 1954. Alice Frost and Joseph Curtin had the title roles when the series began in 1942. The characters, publisher Jerry North and his wife Pam, lived in Greenwich Village at 24 St. Anne's Flat. They were not professional detectives but simply an ordinary couple who stumbled across a murder or two every week for 12 years. The radio program eventually reached nearly 20 million listeners.<br /><br /><br /><b>Novels</b><br /><br />The characters originated in 1930s vignettes written by Richard Lockridge for the New York Sun, and he brought them back for short stories in The New Yorker. These stories were collected in Mr. and Mrs. North (1936). Lockridge increased the readership after he teamed with his wife Frances on a novel, The Norths Meet Murder (1940), launching a series of 26 novels, including Death Takes a Bow, Death on the Aisle and The Dishonest Murderer. Their long-run series continued for over two decades and came to an end in 1963 with the death of Frances Lockridge. The series was unusual in that it was Mrs. North who often solved the cases, while Mr. North was just background much of the time. In his article, \"Married Sleuths,\" Charles L.P. Silet captured the flavor of the novels:<br /><br /><blockquote>The Mr. and Mrs. North novels contain carefully crafted puzzles and the Lockridges usually play fair with their readers. The series also features Pam and Jerry's warmly humorous domestic environment and the couple's witty exchanges with the duller members of the police force. Although the Norths remain the focus of the series, the books contain a good deal of political and social commentary, a richly detailed look at the changing life in New York City, as well as glimpses of the outlying suburban counties. Also, the North's stable marriage relationship presents a marked contrast--and a welcome one--to the traditions of the lone detective characteristic of much other American mystery fiction. Even though the Mr. and Mrs. North novels now may appear overly deliberate in their pacing, they still prove wonderful reading as mysteries, and the glimpses they provide of our past social history give them a nostalgic and authentic period flavor. Aficionados of classic crime fiction have always appreciated this longrunning series, and new readers should be encouraged to discover this witty and charming couple.</blockquote><br /><br /><br /><b>Broadway and Film</b><br /><br />Albert Hackett and Peggy Conklin had the title roles in the Broadway production Mr. and Mrs. North, which ran 163 performances at the Belasco Theatre from January 12, 1941, to May 31, 1941. Alfred De Liagre, Jr. produced and directed the play written by Owen Davis. In that version, the North's apartment is located on Greenwich Place, realized in a scenic design by Jo Mielziner.<br /><br />The Owen Davis play became a 1942 MGM movie starring Gracie Allen and William Post, Jr. with Millard Mitchell repeating his role of Detective Mullins from the Broadway production. Others in the cast were Paul Kelly, Rose Hobart and Keye Luke.<br /><br /><br /><b>Radio</b><br /><br />In 1946, <i>Mr. and Mrs. North</i> received the first Best Radio Drama Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America (in a tie with CBS's <i>Ellery Queen</i>). The program, which was broadcast once in 1941 and continuously from December 1942 through December 1946 on NBC Radio (for Woodbury Soap), and from July 1947 to April 1955 on CBS Radio (for Colgate-Palmolive), featured Carl Eastman (1941), Joseph Curtin (1942-53) and Richard Denning (1953-55) as Jerry North. Pam North was played by Peggy Conklin (1941), Alice Frost (1942-53) and Barbara Britton (1953-55). In his book, <i>Radio Crime Fighters</i>, Jim Cox wrote that the couple:<br /><br /><blockquote>... who passed themselves off as a publisher and his homemaker-spouse continued to make lighthearted wisecracks as they stepped over bodies in dark alleys and were rendered unconscious by unknown assailants dispensing blows to the head almost every week... The feminine half of the twosome was at least equal to the husband in solving cases that often baffled law-enforcement officers with years of training and practiceâexcept in reading clues. No explanation was given, of course, as to why a couple of misfits could be so successful in their preoccupation while the professionals thrashed about ineffectually.\"</blockquote><br /><br /><br /><b>Television</b><br /><br />In 1946, producer-director Fred Coe brought the Owen Davis play to television (on New York City's WNBT) with John McQuade and Maxine Stewart in the leads and Don Haggerty, Joan Marlowe and Millard Mitchell repeating their Broadway roles.<br /><br />Barbara Britton and Richard Denning starred in the tv adaptation, produced by John W. Loveton, seen on CBS from 1952 to 1953 and on NBC in 1954, sponsored by Revlon cosmetics. Francis De Sales starred in 25 episodes as police Lieutenant Bill Weigand, only his second screen role. Guest stars included Raymond Burr, Hans Conried, Russ Conway, Mara Corday, I. Stanford Jolley, Carolyn Jones, Katy Jurado, Jimmy Lydon, Dayton Lummis, Julia Meade, William Schallert, and Gloria Talbott.<br /><br />Sixteen episodes of the TV series have been released in the \"Best of TV Detectives\" box set.<br /><br />Mr. and Mrs. North were resurrected in spirit with ABC's Hart to Hart, the 1979-84 crime drama about a wealthy husband (Robert Wagner) and wife (Stefanie Powers) who spent as much time solving murders and romancing each other as pursuing careers as an industrialist and a journalist, played the crime theme with wry wit reminiscent of the Norths in their heyday.<br /><br /><br /><br /><font size=\"-2\">From WikiPedia.</font><br /><br /><hr /><b><u><br /><br />From the Old Time Radio Researchers Group.

The episodes are fifteen minutes long and serialized as well as having a domestic focus, tending to place the show in the soap opera genre. But the treatment of plot and character is light-hearted and humorous, similar to what is found in the myriad of sitcoms that sprang up during radio's golden age. Papa Bloom (Jake) has reached retirement age, and with some astute help from Mama (Becky) sells his kneepants factory at a nice profit. Together with their \"brood\" -- daughters Yetta and Sarah and sons-in-law Harold and Sidney -- they embark on an automobile trip to Hollywood to enjoy their first vacation in twenty-five years. The party has various adventures along the way. They stop at a resort hotel in Michigan, where Jake stuns even himself by proving to be a fantastically lucky bridge player. In the Arizona desert they are terrified by \"Indians\" (actually movie actors), but escape with scalps intact and soon reach their destination. There Jake, who Becky says is never happy unless he is worrying about something, invests in the motion picture business even though he knows nothing about it. Mama Becky Bloom is a delightful character, much like Molly in \"The Goldbergs,\" with which this series has been compared. She speaks with a heavy Yiddish accent and has trouble with both American English and history. In the desert, she tells Jake that they probably won't see any Indians because she's pretty sure that General Custer killed all of them! She also peppers her speech with fractured platitudes like \"you can't make a zebra change his spots\" and \"you shouldn't go to the well with the same bucket once too many times.\" The program was syndicated about 1934 by Broadcasters Program Syndicate/Bruce Eells and Associates. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

Of course, the best and most popular of the true crime shows was <i>Dragnet</i> -- the monotone, \"just the facts\" style demanded by Jack Webb in the show made two points at once: first, that the show wasn't a typical melodramatic crime show, as had been on radio since \"the good old days\", and more importantly, that we were along for the ride on another day at the office -- in this case, a policeman's “day at the office\". Not a true crime show, as this is drama, but this show features Chuck Morgan, as played by Glen Langen, a very believable news anchor at KOP, a Los Angeles radio station. He is pals with Lieutenant Bill Miggs of the police force, who tips him off to hot crime news. Also in on the capers is Morgan's \"Gal Friday\", Carol Curtis, played by Adele Jurgens. The three meet all types -- mostly on the shady side of the street. In real life, Glen and Adele were husband and wife, the two marrying in 1949. They had met on the movie set of <i>The Treasure of Monte Cristo</i>. On the show, the repartee between the two is strictly old school and quite enjoyable.

    "description": "<blockquote> <p align=\"center\"><i><u><b><font size=\"4\">ESCAPE</font></b></u></i></p> In the Golden Days of Radio, back in the 1930s to the 1950s, most popular radio series had a set time for going out each week. Occasionally, there might be a change in the schedule, but on the whole a consistent time-slot was something that helped build a large audience and so was something the big networks aimed to achieve. One exception to this rule was the dramatic adventure anthology series called <i>Escape</i>, whose time-slot shifted an incredible eighteen times in its seven-year run from 1947 through to 1954. To make matters even worse it had a habit of coming and going and sometimes disappearing off the schedules altogether at short notice for weeks on end only to resurface weeks later in a completely different timeslot. The quite flagrant disregard CBS paid to having a regular timeslot for <i>Escape</i> could make you think that it was just a run-of-the-mill series that was nothing but a lightweight filler for those times when the regular show was off-the-air, such as during the quiet summer months. In my opinion, and that of many old radio aficionados, this couldn't be further from the truth. <i>Escape</i> is probably the best adventure anthology ever broadcast. <i>Escape</i> brings together everything that was good about old-time radio drama rolled into one. The title itself almost sums up the very essence of what radio drama is all about. Each of the episodes was a micro drama carefully planned to capture the listeners attention for thirty minutes. Over two-hundred episodes were made and almost all of them are as good today as they were over half a century ago. For the first few years the series was on air the announcement at the start of the show varied almost every week, but by the 1950s it had settled down to be the now famous: <blockquote>Tired of the everyday grind? Ever dream of a life of romantic adventure? Want to get away from it all? We offer you ... ESCAPE!</blockquote> This may give the wrong impression as <i>Escape</i> was far more than a swashbuckling adventure yarn. It was a brilliantly scripted and superbly produced series that brought to listeners adaptations of classic works by famous writers as well as brand new work by unknown talent. Many of the stories were later reused by more high profile shows such as <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Suspense\" rel=\"nofollow\">Suspense</a>, but on the whole the <i>Escape</i> versions were of equal quality and sometimes more dramatically focused and atmospheric.

This OTRR Collection is a Non-Certified one, containing series in which currently only one or two episodes are known to exist -- hence the name: \"Singles and Doubles Collection\". Almost every type genre is included. Radio -- called by some <i>The Theater of the Mind</i> -- has been with us since 1920 when stations WWJ of Detroit and KDKA of Pittsburg made the first regular commercial broadcasts. The first program aimed at entertaining the unseen audience followed close behind. Over the years since then, literally thousands of series have been broadcast nationally and thousands more in regional or local markets. Some endured for a few years, others for 20 or 30, and some unfortunately only had one episode broadcast. Of those thousands, some series saw some of their episodes saved for the future, some saw nearly all and others only one or two episodes. While the goal of the Old Time Radio Researchers Group is to preserve radios past by collecting, and archiving as many different series as possible and making them available to the community, we do not want to let the series that only had a minimum number of episodes to survive go unpreserved for future generations. To that end we have put together this unique collection of series. Most of the programs you will find here will be totally unfamilar to you, but they are informative and entertaining none the less. This is the second version of this collection that we have released. Since the first collection new broadcasts have surfaced, and others will undoubtely be found in the future. When and if that occurs, we will release a version three. From comedy to drama to cooking shows to music, you'll hear it all here, and every episode will be unique and different. They run the gamut, from the middle 20s to the early 70s, all showing us a glimpse of the past, when things were slower and families gathered round the radio each evening. Times when each person was hearing the same thing, but created a different picture in their minds of what the characters looked like, the scenery, location, and most important the sounds. Sounds that each found a different meaning in, but one that entertained, educated, and made the world a smaller place, where you could hear those stories that in the past were told to just a few, gathered round the dinner table, at a campfire, or in small audiences, but now the whole world could hear and enjoy. Some of these episodes may be misnamed or misdated. If you find such, please let us know. Additionally there may be some dead air space at the beginning or ending of some episodes. This is not one of our certified sets, it is being provided as a way to obtain those series in which only one or two shows have survived. The files are quite large and will take a long time to download on a slow connection. We will be creating a separate page (or pages) for the individual MP3 files. <hr /><b><u>OTRR Certification Information:</u></b> <b>Series Name: </b>Singles and Doubles Collection <b>Certification Status: </b>NON CERTIFIED <b>Certification Date: </b>October 3, 2007 <b>Certification Version: </b>Version 2 <b>Number of CDs: </b>N/A -- this collection equates to 3 DVDs <hr /> Each ZIP file contains series that with begin with the letter(s) found at the end of the ZIP file name.

A search on the internet turned up virtually nothing, and it is not mentioned in any of the reference books, except for a short blurb in Jay Hickerson’s <i>Ultimate Guide</i>. However, it is a very entertaining show. The storyline revolves around neighbors helping neighbors, and using their faith in their daily lives. Believed to have been made in the early 1930s, the series is accented with the main characters practicing their choir hymnals. It was a much simpler time and given today’s atmosphere, it would be great to have that time return. You can go back, if only for 30 minutes at a time. <i>Please contact the Old Time Radio Researchers Group if you have any information on this series.

Strange that so little good science fiction came out of radio; they seem ideally compatible, both relying heavily on imagination. Some fine isolated science fiction stories were developed on the great anthology shows, <i>Suspense</i> and <i>Escape</i>. But until the premiere of <i>Dimension X</i> -- a full two decades after network radio was established -- there were no major science fiction series of broad appeal to adults. This show dramatized the work of such young writers as Ray Bradbury, Robert (Psycho) Bloch, Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and Kurt Vonnegut. In-house script writer was Ernest Kinoy, who adapted the master works and contributed occasional storied of his own. <i>Dimension X</i> was a very effective demonstration of what could be done with science fiction on the air. It came so late that nobody cared, but some of the stories stand as classics of the medium. Bradbury's \"Mars Is Heaven\" is as gripping today as when first heard. His \"Martian Chronicles\" was one of the series' most impressive offerings. <i>Dimension X</i> played heavily on an \"adventures in time and space, told in future tense\" theme. Actors who worked regularly on the show included Joe Di Santis, Wendell Holmes, Santos Ortega, Joseph Julian, Jan Miner, Roger De Koven, John Gibson, Ralph Bell, John Larkin, Les Damon, and Mason Adams. It was directed by Fred Weihe and Edward King. The deep-voiced narrator was Norman Rose. The series played heavily on the \"X\" factor in the title, as did <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_X_Minus_One\" rel=\"nofollow\">X Minus One</a> a few years later. The signature was boomed out of and echo chamber as \"<i>DIMENSION X X X X X x x x x x . . . </i>\" From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.

This show introduces itself succinctly: \"A series of true crime stories from the records and newspapers of every land, from every time. Your host each week, is Mr. Thomas Hyland -- connoisseur of crime, student of violence, and teller of murders. \" Thomas Hyland is played by Lou Merrill, although you'd never know it was an \"actor\" doing the part. The great Elliott Lewis, actor, producer and director of Suspense, Broadway is my Beat and On Stage is in charge of this very intelligent and enjoyable show. Composer Bernard Herrmann duplicated authentic music of the era being dramatized, and Morton Fine and David Friedkin were the writers. Lewis and his writers collected and developed true crime stories expressly for <i>Crime Classics</i>. Thomas Hyland's delivery is measured and mild-mannered, as if giving a college lecture. Would that all professors were this interesting! The actors in the stories themselves are uniformly. Sensitive orchestral scores by the great Bernard Hermann, who did Orson Welles' <i>Mercury Theater</i> radio show and then Alfred Hitchcock's films, give the stories sophistication and mood. So do the tasteful sound effects. There is a wry, cool-blooded tone to the proceedings. Cases ranged from seventeenth-century murder to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Each and every story, however bizarre, is actually based on fact. For example, the show on the Younger Brothers of the American West has some very interesting background details concerning Quantrell's Raiders and the Kansas Jayhawks. In the story of \"John Hayes, his Head, and How They Were Parted,\" we hear the tale of a glassblower who blows glass perfectly and completely surrounding the severed head of a unknown deadman. Then it is placed in a museum where it remained pending identification. Thus his killers were found out by the dead man, using his head. This show is a good companion to other old time radio shows that are historically-oriented, such as <i>Cavalcade of America</i>, <i>You Are There</i>, and <i>American Trail</i>. For science and research, the shows <i>Science Magazine of the Air</i> and <i>Adventures in Research</i> are very good. <font size=\"1\">Information for this description came from John Dunning's \"Tune In Yesterday The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio\".</font> <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">NOTE: Updated Release!

It's also one that is still respected for its high values, in all aspects. <i>Gunsmoke</i> first aired on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS\" rel=\"nofollow\">CBS</a> network on April 26, 1952, billed as the first adult western. It was set in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_City\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dodge City</a>, Kansas in the 1870's. The main character, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshal_Matt_Dillon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matt Dillon</a>, was played by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Conrad\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Conrad</a>. On August 6, 1951, William Conrad played the lead in a show entitled \"Pagosa\" in the series <i>Romance</i>, where he played the part of a reluctant sheriff in a tough Western town. Although not a true audition, Conrad's character role is very close the that of Matt Dillon in <i>Gunsmoke</i>. It was one of the \"stepping stones\" toward the production of <i>Gunsmoke</i>. Other regular characters were Chester Proudfoot, played by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parley_Baer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parley Baer</a>; Kitty, played by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Ellis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Georgia Ellis</a>; and Doc Adams, played by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_McNear\" rel=\"nofollow\">Howard McNear</a>. The series featured top-notch acting and well-developed scripts that set it apart from many other shows, not only Westerns; however, it was the sound effects that stood out the most. Listen carefully and one can hear many levels of sound that really helps transport the listener back to the old west. Besides the US version, there was an Austrailian production of <i>Gunsmoke</i>. It began sometime in 1955, transcribed under the Artransa label, and aired Mondays at 7:00 PM on the Macquarie network. It is not known how many shows aired or how long the series ran.

References to the Ranch Boys are found as early as 1930, though they may have been on earlier. They broadcast over KTM those first few years, nearly every day and at various times. Jack Ross, a versatile actor and producer apparently served as Pinto Pete, with Joe \"Curley\" Bradley and Ken \"Shorty\" Carson rounding out the trio. All three had acted as stuntmen. They also appeared in a few movies, including <i>It Happened One Night</i> and <i>In Old Monterey</i>. The first recorded notice of the <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Pinto_Pete_and_His_Ranch_Boys\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pinto Pete and His Ranch Boys</a> that researcher Ben Kibler was able to locate was a December 13, 1933 broadcast in Sandusky, Ohio. Mentions of the broadcast appeared through 1936. In 1935, they auditioned for the Tom Mix radio show in Chicago and Curley got the part of \"Pecos\", Ross got the lead of \"Tom Mix\", and Carson was to play bit parts. But Ross only got to play Mix once. While in Hollywood doing some movies in the summer of 1938, they rode their horses from Hollywood to Chicago in a publicity stunt that landed them on <i>National Barn Dance</i> for three months. Researcher Ryan Ellett perused the Los Angeles Times from 1930 to 1935 and turned up a few mentions that indicate the trio might have moved on to better pastures. Producer Grace Gibson introduced Australia to <i>Pinto Pete And The Ranch Boys</i> about 1934, according to researcher Ian Grieves, and the program was heard off and on through 1944. They were on the Blue Network in the U.S., according to a 1940 magazine ad, and on a Phoenix Arizona station in 1952. <p><i><b><font size=\"3\">See also the OTRR Singles Companion Release <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Pinto_Pete_and_His_Ranch_Boys_Singles\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pinto Pete and His Ranch Boys</a>.</font></b></i></p> From the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.
